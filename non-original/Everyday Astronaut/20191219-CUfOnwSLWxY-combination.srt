3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,780
在Virginia的Wallops
in Wallops, Virginia.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,240
这里是大西洋中部地区太空港0C号发射台
This is Mars Pad 0C,
注：MARS = Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,550
这座发射台将给Rocket Lab
and this will allow Rocket Lab to launch their

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,670
提供从美国发射小型运载火箭<i>电子</i>的能力
awesome little electron rocket from the United States.
<s>运用自如</s>

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,080
要知道 现在他们只有一个(发射场)LC1
You know, right now they only have launch complex one

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,870
LC1在新西兰 而这是LC2
in New Zealand, this is launch complex two,

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,770
当然我还有很多问题想问
and I still have a lot of questions,

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,330
尤其是 Rocket Lab正在研究电子火箭的可重复使用能力
especially, Rocket Lab is working on reusability for their

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,470
所以我不知道会不会有人
awesome electron rocket, so I wonder if there's anyone

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,260
来回答我几个问题
that could, you know, answer a few more questions about

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,110
特别是关于回收使用的问题
that whole thing.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,760
我们在上面讨论如何
You mind if we talk up here...

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,280
在你的发射台上？
on your launchpad?

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,110
没问题
- No!

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,010
(Tim laughing)

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,110
我们跟这位懂行的聊聊吧
- So I guess let's talk to someone that knows

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,240
关于火箭实验室的很多事情
a lot about everything Rocket Lab.

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,310
别掉坑里 别掉坑里
Don't fall in the pit, don't fall in the pit

21
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,990
别掉坑里
don't fall in the pit.

22
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,820
嘿Peter
Hey Peter!

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,650
嘿Tim 你好吗？
- Hey Tim! - How are ya?

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,490
很高兴再次见到你
- Good to see you again.

25
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,320
有没有感觉屁股快冻住了
- You freezing your butt off out here?

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,360
是的
- Yes. (Tim laughs)

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,500
来这儿度过年末时光挺不错的
- Well, it's a good place to end the year though!

28
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,400
快到2020年了
We're almost 2020! - It is a wonderful

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,330
这地方确实不错
place, yep.

30
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,490
而且 你们这一年的成就难以置信
- And, you guys had an unbelievable year.

31
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,160
是啊 我们队伍2019年的成果让我感到很自豪
- Yeah, I'm super proud of the team for 2019.

32
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,720
年末大家都会为此感到高兴
I think we can end up this year with a smile on their face.

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,640
今年到头 你们一共发射了6次对吧
- Yeah, so you ended up with six launches right?

34
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,470
对
- Yup.

35
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,690
而且 你们现在有两个发射台正在运作
- And, you ended up with two launchpads now online?

36
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,520
对
- Yup.

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,260
而且 你们开始搞重复使用了
- And you, ended up working on recoverability?

38
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,700
是的 当前可重复使用的工作达到了重要阶段
- Yeah, now, we achieved a pretty decent milestone with recoverability, actually.

39
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,890
比我们预期的更好
It was way better than we expected.

40
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,900
那我们从这里开始吧
- As you know, that's what I want to start on,

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,520
这确实是让人感兴趣的话题
'cause that's really exciting.

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,230
所以你以前是听之任之 <i>不知道先生</i>
So, you're sitting back here, mister, I don't know,

43
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,140
可能不是要去尝试 可重复使用能力
probably not gonna try, recoverability

44
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,550
(说)这里面没有利润
doesn't have margins in it.

45
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,690
首先 跟我说说你是怎么转变看法的
First off, tell me what kind of closed for you

46
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,410
也就是重复使用其实是有市场的
on that concept that maybe there is room,

47
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,770
也许是值得的
maybe it's worth it.

48
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,140
说说你的想法
Just run me through your thought process there.

49
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,770
那么 小型运载火箭确实是非常困难的
- So, small launch vehicles are notoriously difficult, right?

50
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,800
导致小型运载火箭的利润如此紧张
'Cause the margin on a small launch vehicle is so tight.

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,250
当你的有效载荷只有150kg时
When you've only got 150 kilograms of payload to play with,

52
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,720
再加入100kg的降落伞是很难处理的事情
adding 100 kilograms of parachutes, it's just very difficult to trade.

53
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,100
- 那么 真正让我考虑这个事情是当我开始看数据
- So, what really got me thinking is I started to look at the data

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,490
发现一级火箭的再入大气之后的生存能力是如此之好
and started to see how well stage one was surviving.

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,280
我们获得了很好的上升段的测量数据
We got good measurements during ascent of the environments, and really,

56
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,940
我开始理解这件事
I started understanding everything that was going on.

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,140
当然 也是为了提高发射频率
And then also, trying to increase launch cadence at the same time,

58
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,590
至于工厂
and steering out into a factory

59
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,080
我之前就决定必须要把工厂扩建一倍
where we knew we were going to have to double the size of this factory,

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,090
然后继续建造更多机器
and just keep on building more and more machines,

61
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,290
让制造过程变得更加自动化
and automating more and more and more,

62
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,480
工厂这边的事是很明确的 话说回来 火箭回收这边的数据并不夸张
and it just sort of became obvious, well, the data doesn't say that it's insane,

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,830
是很困难 但还不至于打破物理法则
it says it's difficult, but we're not breaking any laws of physics here.

64
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,430
- 如此 我在公司内部组建了一个小团队
- So, yeah, I formed a small team within the company

65
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,070
并着手完成这个项目
and we started to go after it.

66
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,340
- 你有像Wile E. Coyote的黑板那样的说明来简单介绍一下这个工作吗
- Do you have, just a chalkboard full of Wile E. Coyote style, what's going to work for us?
注：华纳的动画Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner(威利狼与哔哔鸟)

67
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,150
-  是啊 肯定有大量的白板讨论
- Yeah, I mean there was plenty of whiteboard sessions, that's for sure.

68
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,510
- 跟我分享一下 在你尝试这件事之前
- Share with me, one other one, before you landed on, was there even something close,

69
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,970
是否有其他竞争者尝试做空中的回收？
another contender before you landed on trying to do the air recovery?

70
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,140
- 是啊 考虑到最后把火箭降落到回收网里
- Yeah, I mean we looked at landing it in a net
注：av78382556

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,210
和SpaceX所做的没有什么不同呢
not dissimilar to what SpaceX does with experience.

72
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,420
更不用说反推式再入
Obviously, we looked at propulsive re-entry,

73
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,720
但这个事情就像是你只有半张餐巾纸写字一样
but that was, you know, you only get half a napkin filled out

74
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,630
最后你会发现这行不通的
before you realize that's just not going to work.

75
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,540
(Tim laughing)

76
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,550
没错 团队里大家有很多不同的想法
And then, yeah, there was all sort of all different concepts from the team, you know,
(Tim laughing)

77
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:21,500
And then, yeah, there was all sort of all different concepts from the team, you know,
没错 团队里大家有很多不同的想法

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,480
类似巨型无人机 或者其他很多东西
giant drones, and all sorts of stuff, yeah.

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,660
- 啊 对 这正是我想问的
- Yeah, okay, I guess we're going to pop right into that, that's actually,

80
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,740
我和一些人做了一个播客叫 <i>Our Ludicrous Future(我们滑稽的未来)</i>
I do a podcast with some guys, it's called "Our Ludicrous Future",

81
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,510
每周 我们会收集人们的问题
and each week, we take people's questions of

82
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,570
<i>他们为什么不只是...</i>
"Why don't they just..."

83
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,400
- 是啊 是啊 没错
- Yeah, yeah, right.

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,320
- 这是个好问题 <i>为什么不干脆用个巨大的无人机呢</i>
- And that was a good one, it was "Why don't they just use a giant drone,

85
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,610
<i>你们已经有电池了</i>
you guys already have batteries,

86
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,990
<i>你有电动机 使用它的话会比操作一个直升机便宜</i>
you have motors, and it could be cheaper than operating a helicopter,

87
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,050
<i>甚至能搞成四轴的</i>
you could even do four of them that fly in unison",

88
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,150
为什么最后没有这么做呢？
why didn't that end up working out?

89
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,650
- 嗯 我的意思是 我正准备我的直升机驾照 所以
- Well, I mean, I'm trying to get my helicopter's license, so,

90
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,780
使用直升机很好
- (laughs) I know you are. using a helicopter is great.

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,520
- 只是因为你想多飞下直升机吗？
- Is this just you wanting to fly a helicopter more often?

92
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,110
- 不 不 不 但它有一个小原子在里面
- No, no, no, but there's a small atom of it.
注：电子和原子梗

93
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,050
(Tim Laughing)

94
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,850
当然不是这样 我是指用直升机捕获这件事在之前已经被很多人做过了
But, no, I mean, many have recaptured with a helicopter, it's been done before.

95
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,080
很多人看到这个
And I know a lot of people look at that and

96
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,310
他们就会说这些话 <i>这也太难搞了</i>
they sort of, they say "Man that's super tricky"

97
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,110
和 <i>这么难的事情怎么能做成呢？</i>
and "How are they going to pull that off?"

98
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,810
但实际上这是相对正统(理论)的做法
but really that is, relatively academic,

99
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,620
比起让火箭再入并让其幸存要稍微正统一点
compared to actually re-entering the stage and getting it through one bit.

100
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,180
- 好吧 你与一些公司合作
- Right, well, do you work with the company

101
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,960
是那些位于苏格兰或英格兰那些有回收系统的公司吗？
that was based out of, was it Scotland or England, that has the recovery system?

102
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,890
真的吗
Really?

103
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,780
- 不 不
- No, no.

104
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,850
- 好吧 当然 网上的那些人马上就发现了
- Okay, 'ccause, of course, everyone on the internet immediately saw

105
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,940
你们这些人正着手研究的东西<i>没错 这个已经有人做出来了</i>
what you guys are working on, and go "Well, this has already been done"

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,940
<i>一家公司的一个视频 内容是回收一个带翼伞的模型火箭</i>
here's a video of company recovering a, it was a mock-up booster with a parafoil.

107
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,020
- 是啊 可这件事在此之前就已完成
- Yeah, I mean it's been done.

108
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,760
洛克希德·马丁公司大概90年代就做到了
Lockheed Martin did it, I think it was in the 90's,

109
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,270
他们尝试回收一些再入的人造物体
to try and recover some re-entered artifacts, so yeah.
注：www.ulalaunch.com/docs/default-source/evolution/partial-rocket-reuse-using-mid-air-recovery-2008-7874.pdf

110
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,620
如果你追溯到更早的时期
I mean it's in, you know, if you go back far enough

111
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,750
你看看日冕计划
you look at the Corona missions,
注：1959-1972年美国战略侦察卫星任务，再入之后，搭载胶卷的卫星返回舱通过固定翼飞机在空中回收

112
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,670
尽管(ULA回收的那部分)用的是直升机 但和这个也差不多
all that was in a helicopter, it's still the same gig.

- 对 没错
- Right, same, yup.

115
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,050
在它溅落之前回收它
swooping it up before it hits the water.

116
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,280
- 是啊 这基本上一样
- Yup, that's pretty much it.

117
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,900
- 那么 你有多少时间
- And, how much time do you have

118
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,250
在溅落和降落伞部署之间
between when the parachutes deploy, and before it hits the ground?

119
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,890
- 所以这就是我们用翼伞的想法 可以用风控制它
- Yeah, so that's the idea of the parafoil is we can steer it into the wind,

120
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,150
最大程度的延长滞空时间
and maximize the hang-time there.

121
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,630
差不多可以维持20分钟
So, you could have up to twenty minutes.

122
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,280
- 所以这么说你可以用直升机多次尝试回收过程
- Really? So you could have multiple attempts with the helicopter.

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,720
- 是啊  所以我们尝试并限制下降率最大为每秒10米
- Yeah, yup, and so we try and limit the descent rate to a maximum of 10 meters a second

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,860
这么看去用钩子回收的几率很大
so you know, you get a decent opportunity to go and scoop it.

125
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,820
- 好吧 听起来不错
- Okay, that's pretty cool, so I guess,

126
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,360
所以近期之内真的没有无人机了吗？
no autonomous drones in the near-time future?

127
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,740
- 不会的 以前只讨论过无人船 但现在不考虑无人机
- No, there was talk of autonomous ships at one point, but, no, no autonomous drones at this point.

128
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,570
- 好吧 这是你对 <i>为什么不干脆用无人机</i>(的回答)
- Okay, so that's your "Why don't they just use (laughs) drones."

129
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,920
- Peter喜欢驾驶直升机
- Peter likes flying a helicopter.

130
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,560
- 这就是原因
- Because Peter loves flying helicopters, that's why.

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,880
不过 没关系 关于反推 很多人说
No, okay, so propulsive, that came up in a lot of discussions, people say,

132
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,600
<i>他们为什么不做反推式再入？</i>
"Why don't they do propulsive re-entry?"

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,220
答案很简单 最有可能是 你不需要它
The simple answer, most likely, is that you don't need it.

134
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,910
你的一级火箭能够扛下高温墙
Your booster can survive, it survived the wall.

135
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,790
- 没错 它确实扛过了高温墙
- Yeah it did survive the wall.

136
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,860
- 而且不需要反推来减速
- Without propulsive slowdown.

137
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,810
- 而且它不仅扛下了高温墙
- And not only did it survive the wall,

138
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,550
而且还是最差的再入弹道
it's the worst possible descent you could imagine,

139
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,130
绝对没有加上任何减速部件
there was absolutely no deceleration device on it whatsoever,

140
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,420
就是这么热的情况下撑了过来
so it was just coming in screamin' hot.

141
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,820
- 那么 好吧 那么问题来了
- So, okay, a couple questions come out of that,

142
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,010
对不起 我就是要好好问清楚这里的问题
sorry, I'm just going to keep digging through here, because...

143
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,270
你的发动机卢瑟福能二次点火吗
Does your engine, the Rutherford, does it actually have re-light capability?
注：Rutherford是电子火箭一二级的发动机

144
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,800
- 因为使用的是火炬式点火器 而不是TEA-TAB 所以能多次点火
- Well, I mean, we don't use TEA-TEB, we use an igniter torch, so yes it does.
注：TEA-TAB是化*学点火燃料，但是不代表不能多次点火，猎鹰9号使用的就是TEA-TAB

145
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,360
但我们不常用它 因为还有别的事要准备
But, we don't actively use it, I mean there's a few things we'd need to do,
注：TEA-TAB是化学点火燃料，但是不代表不能多次点火，猎鹰9号使用的就是TEA-TAB

146
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,350
我们需要用氮或者别的东西来清洗燃烧室
we'd need to purge the chambers with some nitrogen and stuff,
注：详见space.stackexchange.com/questions/13953/how-do-the-falcon-9-engines-re-ignite

147
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,050
在发射的火箭上则完全不使用这个功能
but we don't actually use it on the launch vehicle,

148
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,150
二次点火能力(对整个电子火箭的发射过程)而言是没有太大意义的
but it's relatively trivial to make it relightable.

149
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,030
- 但是 你从来没遇到过需要二次点火的任务吗
- But, you've never had missions or anything where you need a relight?

150
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,860
- 没有
- No

151
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,100
- 这就是kick stage的工作吗
- And that's what the kick stage is for?
注：kick stage是电子火箭的三级部分(可选分级)，或者说上面级，可以翻译成 <i>踢一脚级</i>

152
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,320
- 是啊 kick stage很好
- Yeah, well, the kick stage is beautiful,
注：kick stage是电子火箭的三级部分(可选分级)，或者说上面级，可以翻译成 <i>踢一脚级</i>

153
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,890
对于圆化轨道而言 它的推进系统的大小恰到好处
because it's a right-sized propulsion system for trying to circulize
注：kick stage是电子火箭的三级部分(可选分级)，或者说上面级，可以翻译成 <i>踢一脚级</i>

154
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,560
而且轨道注入真的很准确
and insert really, really accurately.
注：kick stage是电子火箭的三级部分(可选分级)，或者说上面级，可以翻译成 <i>踢一脚级</i>

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,590
达到这种精度 对于一级火箭和二级火箭而言是很难的
That's the trouble with doing kind of a second light on a stage two is that

156
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,240
哪怕只是点火几秒钟也都过度了
you're only lit for a few seconds, and it's just a big thump.

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,930
但是居里却要点火20-30秒(才能达到相同的效果) 这样就能获得很高的精度
Whereas the Curie burns for like 20 or 30 seconds and you just get exquisite accuracy.
注：Curie(居里)是kick stage的发动机

158
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,810
- kick stage进行的是时间长 但是推力小的推进过程
- Yeah, yeah, you have a long, it's such a low thresh,

159
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,380
换成推力大的发动机就只要很短时间
or, you can do a tiny little bit of burn, right?

160
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,170
- 让我最满意的东西是调整轨道时做的圆化点火
- I tell you, there is nothing more satisfying than when we would do the circularization burn on the trims,

161
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,590
在任务控制中心 能看到目标轨道和(实际)上升轨道
is you know, in mission control, we have the couple of lines, the target line, and then the ascent line,

162
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,390
看着这两条轨道在30多秒内缓慢地靠近并重合在一起真是令人难以置信的满足
and just watching those two lines just inch together and converge over 30 seconds is just incredibly satisfying,

163
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,740
很美丽
they just (buzzes), and they just pop, it's just beautiful.

164
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,620
- 很精彩 最近有个SpaceX的任务
- That is actually amazing, and there was a recent SpaceX mission where,
注：指20191111 starlink mission av75397301 (60+4):55 或 youtu.be/pIDuv0Ta0XQ?t=3599

165
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,310
他们的上面级(二级)使用梅林引擎 过于强大
you know they have such an overpowered upper stage with their Merlin engine
注：指20191111 starlink mission av75397301 (60+4):55 或 youtu.be/pIDuv0Ta0XQ?t=3599

166
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,740
我觉得他们大概
where they, I think they lit it (snaps) for like,

167
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,170
点火点了不到半秒钟
it wasn't even, it was like a half second, or something.

168
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,970
就像爆炸一样
They were just like (explosion imitation).

169
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,220
稍纵即逝
It's like wow, I can't imagine the startup transience

170
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,750
就是晃动了一下
and all that stuff, just for that one, quick, little jolt.

171
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,850
而你们呢
And you guys are able to, with, when,

172
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,830
现在升级成了光子上面级
now you upgraded, too, your Photon, and, do you still do,

173
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,210
光子不使用居里发动机
do you fly Photon and Curie separate,

174
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,700
还是说从此往后上面级都叫光子了？
or is it all just Photon now?

175
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,930
- 这里面有些争议
- Yeah, no, so, well it's a bit of a debate really.

176
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,150
kick stage现在就是指光子
So, the kick stage is really just a Photon now,

177
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,560
但也有不同的种类
but we have different variants, so we have a

178
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,580
对于kick stage 我们有单组元推进剂的和双组元推进剂的
mono-propellant kick stage and a bi-propellant kick-stage.

179
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,860
所以 你知道 对于不要求额外性能的任务
So, you know, for missions that don't require the extra performance,

180
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,820
我们更偏向于用单组元推进剂
we just prefer to run mono-propellant,

181
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,040
因为(对于单组元推进剂)你只需要打开一下阀门
because, you just gotta open a valve, that's it.

182
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,310
但是 对于性能要求较高的任务 我们用双组元推进剂
But, for higher performing missions, we run the bi-propellant.

183
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,110
- 单组元和双组元之间的比冲差异多大
- What's the specific impulse difference between mono-prop and dual-prop?

184
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,200
- 差不多50-60秒
- It's quite big, you know, it would be probably 50 seconds, 60 seconds, something like that,

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,300
确实挺大的
so it's pretty decent.

186
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,570
- 换用双组元之后 你将获得多少dv提升呢
- And, how much delta V does that afford you when you go to the dual-prop?

187
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,130
- 我不记得确切的数字
- I can't remember the exact number,

188
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,900
因为这取决于推进剂储箱的组合
because it depends on what propellant tank combination we're running as well.

189
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,990
上面级的灵活性体现在不同任务中进行不同的配置
So, we've got quite a lot of flexibility in that upper stage to really change it up depending on missions.

190
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,900
譬如像第10次飞行中到达400km的轨道
I mean, flight 10, we flew to a high orbit to 400 Ks,

191
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,300
释放部分卫星后 再次点火 降低轨道 然后再部署一些
and then, we did a re-light, and lowered, and then deployed some more.

192
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,240
越来越多的这类任务
So, you know, more and more of these missions,

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,060
会涉及到多次点火 变轨之类的东西
we're finding, we do multiple re-lights, and change orbits and stuff.

194
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,810
- 是的 这对客户很有价值 可以直接部署到他们想去的轨道
- Yeah, it's a value to the customer to be able to go directly to where they need to go,

195
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,060
他们自己不需要再做推进的工作
they don't have to have their own propulsion and do all that stuff.

196
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,100
- 这正是专用火箭的意义所在
- Well that's the whole point of dedicated rocket, right?
注：专用相对拼车而言，譬如相对猎鹰9号的拼车任务SmallSat Rideshare Program

197
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,260
对于共同搭载类任务而言是做不到的
I mean, if you can't do that, then, it's a ride share.
注：专用相对拼车而言，譬如相对猎鹰9号的拼车任务SmallSat Rideshare Program

198
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,750
- 没错
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

199
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,770
那么 你们还有个任务是要去月球的吗
So, do you guys still have a mission going out to the moon, is that correct?

200
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,600
- 是啊
- Yeah.

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,760
- 那么kick stage的地月转移轨道的载荷有多少 或者它能抵达完全的地月转移轨道吗
- Yeah, is that, so how much of that is riding on the kick stage, does the kick stage do the full TLI?

202
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,590
- 没错 光子能做到这点
- Yeah, it's Photon.

203
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,720
- 真的吗？ - 是的 基本能达到
- Really? - Yeah, we'll basically

204
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,270
光子上面级能到月球
just take a Photon to the moon.

205
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,350
- 那这一脚有多少dv
- Wow, it has that much Delta V kick?

206
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,480
- 正如我前面说的 可以配置储罐不同的储罐组合
- Yeah, yeah, so, like I say we can configure it and change tank configurations, so,

207
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,980
光子到月球的计划 只是相当于在有效载荷平台上加了个大储罐
you know, Photon to the moon is just basically a big tank on top of the payload deck.

208
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,410
而光子里面还集成了导航 通信 以及其他必要的东西
You know, everything is already there, all the guidance, comms, and everything, it's just there.

209
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,930
在设计居里发动机时 就考虑到要让其能工作很长的时间
And, you know, we architected the Curie engine in a way that it could burn for a very long time.

210
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,320
所以 -
So, yeah, it's not--

211
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,870
- 它能带多个载荷
- Would it take multiple, I'd assume it'd take multiple

212
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,850
- 没错
- Yeah, yeah you want

213
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,210
- 轨道注入点火？ - 优化它
- insertion burns? - to optimize it.

214
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,660
直接入轨代价比较高 但是 -
Direct inject's expensive, but--

215
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,150
- 看到这些让人振奋人心
- That will be really exciting to see that.

216
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,890
想想这种尺寸的火箭
I mean, just thinking that a rocket this size,

217
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,440
一个小火箭也能把有效载荷带到月球
a relatively small rocket will be able to take a payload to the moon I mean--

218
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,860
- 这在很多方面都会振奋人心 因为它带来了很多不同的机会
- Yeah, and I think it's exciting on a lot of fronts, because it opens up so many different opportunities.

219
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,770
TLI很难 但我们也可以去地球同步轨道 或者日心轨道
You know, TLI injection is great, but we can also go to GEO we can do a heliocentric,

220
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,980
但是这种能力让人振奋
but there's all sorts of stuff you can do, which are really exciting.

221
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,610
- 我甚至没有想到GEO
- I didn't even think about GEO.

222
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,020
我肯定以前没有这样的小型火箭做到过
I'm sure there's never been a rocket this small putting anything in geostationary orbit, right?

223
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,970
- 确实没有
- No, no I'm sure.

224
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,480
- 甚至想接近都做不到
- I mean, not even close.

225
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,460
所以 这是相当惊人的
So, that's pretty amazing.

226
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,680
这之中大家都想问的是
One of the things that everyone's, you know, definitely questioning is,

227
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,210
为回收所准备的硬件
some of the hardware that's required to do some of your recovery stuff,

228
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,750
你用双组元推进剂有(弥补回收导致的)dv不足这方面的考虑吗
is that one of the reasons you also went dual-prop, is to make up for that delta V difference?

229
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,460
- 当然 不管是电子的哪个部分 我们都在努力提高它的性能
- Yeah, I mean, wherever we, we're continually trying to improve the performance of electron

230
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,320
通过提高性能来减少回收的影响
to both gain margin and also offset the changes that we're making with recovery.

231
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,050
但正如我之前说的 如果任务不需要它
But, like I said before, if a mission doesn't require it,

232
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,760
那我们一般不会用上它 我们只用单组元推进剂
then we generally won't put it on, we'll just run mono-propellant.

233
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,090
- 是啊 所以总体来说
- Yeah, so overall,

234
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:10,160
相比于第1次飞行 你在第10次飞行的过程中做了任何电池或者发动机的优化吗
have you done any changes to batteries or optimization of the engines between flight one and 10 now that have--

235
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,500
- 很惊人的是 很少部分的系统发生了改变
- It's amazing really, remarkably few systems have really changed.

236
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,860
我们之前增进了对火箭各系统的了解 这样才能提高余量
You know, we've understood the systems better, so we've been able to pull back margin,

237
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,130
但真的没有对任何一个系统进行了重新设计
but there's been no kind of major re-architect of really any system.

238
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,380
2020年我们也会如此小幅改进
You know, we'll continue this year, 2020 we'll continue to kind of tweak,

239
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,840
也会一直进行增强
and make a few improvements along the way,

240
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,290
因为回收 我们会在一级上加质量
because we will be adding a bit of mass on stage one to recover,

241
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,080
在这个简单的路线图上 给载具增加性能
so we've got a pretty simple road map, there, to add performance to the vehicle.

242
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,110
- 方便的话 你能说下为了回收 一级加了多少质量吗
- If you don't mind me asking, how much mass is added for first stage recoverability?

243
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:52,760
- 这真的取决于下降弹道和降落伞(的设计)有多成功
- It really depends on how successful the ballistic descents are with parachutes.

244
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,860
我觉得一级应该增重不超过150kg 但你要知道这些比例
I mean, I would imagine probably no more than 150 kgs on stage 1, but you have to remember the ratios.

245
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,190
- 那这比例大概是4比1？
- Yes, what was it, about 4:1?

246
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,600
- 其实 对电子火箭而言很多
- Actually, on electron it's much, much more than that.

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,730
因为2级做的工作更多 对1级而言比例更接近8比1
'Cause stage 2 does so much of the work, so it's probably more like 8:1 on a stage 1.
注：可以参考flight club提供的电子火箭速度时间曲线 flightclub.io/result/2d?id=106ddf97-8dc2-4573-a022-ad3305f89cee

248
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,280
- 真的吗
- Really?

249
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,860
- 是的 所以在下面(一级)可以带多一些质量
- Yeah, so we can carry a lot of mass down there.

250
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,470
- 我需要给观众解释下
- I should also explain for those watching and listening,

251
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,710
这意味着他们可以给一级加些质量
that means, basically, they can add a bunch of weight to the first stage

252
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,120
而不会对有效载荷带来同等质量的损失
and it doesn't take nearly as much payload penalty as it does

253
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,550
这与上面级的质量增加不同
if you were to stick that weight on the upper stage.

254
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,240
所以你在一级增加8kg质量
So, you add eight kilograms to the first stage,

255
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,550
只会让有效载荷质量损失1kg
it'll only detract about one kilogram from your payload capability.

256
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,480
那么另一个问题是 <i>以前有过什么想法吗</i>
So, I guess, that's another question, then, is, "Has there ever been any thoughts?"

257
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,330
好吧 我先问问你上面级的比冲有多少
Okay, I'm going to ask this first, how much specific impulse is your upper stage?

258
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,160
- 是说卢瑟福吗
- So the Rutherford, or--

259
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,320
- 啊 是的 是搭载卢瑟福发动机的上面级(二级)
- The Rutherford, yeah, sorry, the Rutherford upper stage.

260
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,490
- 它比冲大概有342秒(卢瑟福真空版)
- Yeah, so, it's around about 342

261
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,840
差不多
I think, 'round about there.

262
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,230
它是个声音很大的高性能小发动机
It's high performance, it's a screaming, little engine.

263
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,600
是啊 大概97％ seastar(?) 效率
Yeah, it's about 97% seastar efficient, 97, 98.

264
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,570
相当可以
It's a screamer.

265
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,440
- 那么 有没有想过给上面级(二级)换个燃料
- So, has there ever been any thoughts of going with a different propellant on the upper stage,

266
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,840
或者一级也行 譬如甲烷 你们想过甲烷吗
or the first stage, like methane, have you guys looked into methane?

267
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,250
- 真没这么想过
- Yeah, not really. I mean, I...

268
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,330
我喜欢煤油
I love Kero.

269
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,940
这里面可以展开很多话题
I mean I know there's a lot of talk about,

270
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,120
<i>两种低温推进剂总比一个低温一个常温好</i>
"Well, it's easier to have two cryogenic propellants than one cryogenic and one not."

271
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,080
我不想处理第二种低温推进剂 特别是液态甲烷还容易燃烧
Well, I prefer not to deal with another cryogenic propellant, personally, especially one that's a bit flamey.

272
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,310
如果你见过了
I mean if you've seen...

273
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,450
SpaceX公司最近发生的一些事情
some of the stuff from SpaceX recently,

274
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,650
甲烷肯定喜欢着火
that methane sure likes to go on fire a lot.

275
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,090
煤油是非常不同的
Kerosene is much different, like that.

276
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,290
虽然这之中会有一些性能提升
So, I mean, there's probably some performance upgrades there,

277
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,360
但是煤油操作起来更方便
but just the handleability of kerosene and just the ease of it.

278
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,550
我们努力要做的是批量生产并发射出去
What we're trying to do here is just churn launch out,

279
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,080
增加复杂度实在不是我们想做的
so, you know, adding systems that add complexity is not really a gig.

280
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,890
- 这就像你的名片一样 保持越简单越好
- I was gonna say that is almost like your calling card, it's like, keep it as simple as possible.

281
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,230
每个人都希望简单 也就像懒人工程师一样
Everyone wants to, and this is, again very much an armchair engineer thing,

282
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,010
很多航空粉丝就像
there's very much fans of aerospace going like

283
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,870
<i>如果他们做了这项 那项增强 他们也许就能发射400kg载荷</i>
"But, they could probably launch 400 kilograms if they switched to this, and this, and this!"

284
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,660
这就像权衡利弊的好处
It's like, what's the trade-off benefit of that?

285
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,190
为了增加客户 有效载荷的机会等等
Are you actually going to increase your amount of customers, payload opportunities,

286
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,750
而研发这些新的复杂的东西
XYZ for all these new complications, all this new R&D.

287
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,640
我记得我们上次提到了气尖发动机
I remember we spoke about aerospikes last time
注：20181102发布的视频 youtu.be/Nj9BncsgvuQ?t=2371

288
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,880
这算是完美的例子之一
I talked to you, and that's one of the perfect example of

289
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,520
<i>也许它可以在某些事情上有帮助 或改善某些情况 但到了最后
"maybe it might help in some things, or improve certain situations, but by the end of the day,</i>

290
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,260
<i>即使你能让它完美运转</i>
even if you get it working perfectly,

291
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,930
<i>你让它工作所耗费的成本花费了多少 而且长远来看这是否值得</i>
how much did you spend to get it working, and is it worth it in the long run?"

292
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,580
- 是的
- Yeah, that's exactly right.

293
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,020
- 你最后可能又回到了最初
- You might end up right back on page one, you know?

294
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,700
那么 优化上面级
Okay, so optimizing the upper stage.

295
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,380
不会通过液态甲烷或者其他低温燃料 或者改变系统的方式来实现
So, probably not going to liquid methane or any other cryogenic fuels, or changing up systems.

296
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,760
我有两个关于上面级的问题
I've always had a question, two questions about upper stage.

297
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,650
- 好的
- Okay.

298
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,140
- 你同时分离两个电池
- You ditch both batteries at the same time.

299
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,970
- 没错
- Correct.

300
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,820
- 为什么没打算分阶段分离他们
- Is there a reason you don't stage them;

301
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,430
一个接着一个
one and then the other?

302
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,450
- 没错 有效载荷会因此有轻微上涨
- Yeah, I mean the, payload gained by doing that is relatively minor,

303
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,030
但是一次分离两个的优点是你不会引入多余的扭矩
so the beauty of staging two at once is you don't introduce any torque offsets,

304
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,450
因为它们分离时产生的力矩互相抵消了
because they null each other out.

305
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,010
- 一个(接着一个)
- One, right.

306
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,610
- 其中一个下来的时候 有点抖动 但是加上另外一个
- Whereas if you poke one off, then you sort of punch one way and then the other,

307
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,410
就会发现导航系统能很顺利地解决这个问题
and look, the guidance will deal with that no problem at all,

308
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,160
在分离两块电池时 你会发现导航系统
you see the guidance when you punch both of them off,

309
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,810
甚至没有察觉到分离的动静 整流罩分离时也是如此
it just doesn't even know it's there, and same with the fairings.

310
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,690
如此 这也是从一开始就降低风险的设计
So, really that came about from day one trying to minimize risk.

311
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:24,270
特别是对于这么小的有效载荷而言 就不要再引入更多的风险了
And, yeah, for just a tiny amount of payload just don't introduce more risk.

312
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,520
- 没错 又是那个<i>不要再引入更多风险</i>
- Yeah, yup, again the whole "Don't introduce more risk."

313
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,170
二级总是有有火花从喷管中喷出
Second stage has a bunch of sparks that always shoot out of the nozzle.

314
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,490
那个是咋回事儿啊
What's that from again?

315
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,780
- 卢瑟福发动机效率很高
- Yeah, so, the Rutherford engine is really high performance,

316
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,170
这件事儿挺有趣的 你常听人们说
and what that actually is, it's quite funny, you see people talking,

317
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,860
<i>哦 他们一定有个桨式喷嘴</i>
"Oh, they must've had a bladed nozzle"

318
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,320
<i>尽管它泛着鲜艳的红色</i>
despite the fact that it's glowing bright red.

319
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,300
不过这其实是一些碳质沉积
But, no, they're little soot deposits.

320
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,490
这些碳质堆积到喷注器上就像钟乳石一样
So, the soot deposits kind of build up on the injector face like stalactites,

321
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,610
积累到一定规模 就会掉渣
and then they get to a certain size, and then break free,

322
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,420
接着这些碳质就夹杂在尾气流中吹走了
and then that's the carbon entrained into the exhaust plane.

323
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,250
- 真的吗？
- Really?

324
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,660
- 是啊
- Yeah.

325
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,620
- 这就是RP-1的碳质？
- So that's your soot of RP-1?

326
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,450
- 对
- Yup.

327
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,050
- 哇 而且射出来看起来像小火花一样
- Wow, and shooting out as what looks like little sparks?

328
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,060
- 小火花 是的
- Little sparks, yeah.

329
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,890
- 真的啊
- Really?

330
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,810
- 是的 但是喷注器的效率还是很高的
- Yeah, but that injector, the efficiency is, it's a good injector,

331
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,990
所以这是真的 -
so it's really--

332
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,890
- 你们表面是怎么做的 是同轴形状的 还是
- Are you guys doing on-face, like do you go coaxial, or what do you--
注：关于喷注器形状，可以参考 youtu.be/aa4ATJGRqA0

333
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,900
- 这是一个很好的喷注器
- It's a good injector.

334
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,380
- <i>这是一个很好的喷注器</i> 口风很严
- It's a good injector, (laughs) keeping it tight.

335
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,210
好好好
I love it.

336
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,350
好 我们已经讨论过了
Okay, so, we've talked about that, we talked about

337
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,350
喷注器 甲烷 喷火花的发动机
the injections, we talked about methane, sparky engines.

338
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,390
好的 回到可回收能力 我们只围绕这个话题谈
Okay, so, back to recoverability, we're going to wrap this all around.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,010
你完全没必要为可回收做任何空气动力的系统吗
You didn't have to do any aero-systems at all for your recoverability?

340
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,070
- 没有任何空气动力的附件
- Not any aero-appendages,

341
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,490
整个一级是靠RCS控制的
but the whole stage was guided through RCS.
注：RCS = Reaction control system(反推力系统)，用于调整航天器姿态的小推力反推系统

342
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,070
只需要一些RCS发动机
So, a little Reaction Control Rocket motors.

343
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,090
- 那些RCS发动机很小很可爱
- Little tiny, they're cute.

344
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,150
- 是的 它们是小可爱
- Yeah, they're a little cute.

345
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,390
那些小家伙啊
They're little guys, yeah.

346
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,220
- 但这个控制力足以指向正确的方向了吗
- But, that's enough control authority to keep you pointed in the right direction?

347
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,550
- 是的 这很有趣
- Yeah, so, it's really interesting,

348
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,130
对一级而言 那种超音速状态下的动态稳定性
you know, the kind of dynamic stability of the stage and the hypersonic regime is...

349
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,950
只有在亚音速状态下 它才有翻转的力
It's when we get into the subsonic regime, then it wants to turn itself backwards,

350
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,730
但是在超音速状态下 其实挺稳定的
but, during the hypersonic regime, it's actually quite stable.

351
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,610
- 因为是发动机朝下 而且 -
- Because of the engines being first, and--

352
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,920
- 因为发动机和电池都在底部 所以质量也集中在底部
- The engines and the batteries are all at the bottom, so all the mass is down there at the bottom.

353
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:17,830
所以差不多在二级点火5秒以后
So, when we... about 5 seconds after second stage ignited,

354
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,890
我们就开始一种机动 首先是翻转
we started the kind of, maneuver, and the first maneuver was to do a flip-around,

355
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,210
然后指向再入通道的方向
and then align with the re-entry corridor.

356
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,860
这个看起来也很好 因为我在屏幕上也能看到
That was so good, too, because I had that on my screen as well,

357
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,420
当时我看得很仔细
I was watching that very carefully,

358
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,900
只是看着那些比率下降
and you know, just watching those rates come down,

359
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,420
它们都收敛到零
and they all just converged down to zero,

360
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,380
我当时想 <i>这是好事</i>
and I was like, "This is good!"

361
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,210
只需要坐着等 那些数值就都归零了
So, this thing is just sitting bang on zero,

362
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,380
我想 <i>这是件好事</i>
I thought "this is good."

363
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,980
接着一级火箭就抵达了最高点
And then, you know, we started to reach apogee, and then you see the, you know,
注：一级火箭分离时，仍有垂直向上的分速度，所以仍未到达最高点，是分离后才到达

364
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,500
方向矢量没问题
the alignment vector come all good,

365
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,650
一切数值保持在正常状态
and then it just stayed all good,

366
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,810
然后那些RCS的小发动机点火 并完成自己的工作
and the little engines are firing away and doing their thing.

367
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,750
火箭有点滚转 但滚转是我们不太在意的那个坐标轴
We saw a bit of roll, but roll is the least damped axis,

368
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,350
处理滚转总是很难
so, you know, it's always hard to deal with roll.

369
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,810
- 而且 你不必让(主)发动机二次点火
- And, you're not having to re-light engines,
注：对液体燃料火箭而言，失重状态下二次点火前需要防止燃料飞溅

370
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,470
所以你不必担心储罐里燃料飞溅之类的事情
so you don't have to worry about tank sloshes or anything.
注：对液体燃料火箭而言，失重状态下二次点火前需要防止燃料飞溅

371
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,540
- (适当)滚转是有益的 特别是那种烧烤滚转 这样你就不会(把仪器)烤熟了
- Roll is good, a bit of barbecue roll, it's good so you don't cook things up.
注：否则燃料输送可能出现问题

372
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,810
但是 所有的功劳归导航控制团队
But, all credit to the GNC team,
注：GNC = Guidance, Navigation and Control (应该是)

373
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:16,180
他们持续几周半夜两点提交代码并进行调整
they were committing code at 2 o'clock in the morning for weeks and weeks, and tweaking,

374
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,460
那些人实在是
and tweaking, and tweaking, so, those guys are just.

375
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,890
你看看载具的精度
I mean, you see the accuracy of the vehicle,

376
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,020
都要归功于他们 太不可思议了
and it's all down to those guys, they're just incredible, incredible.

377
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,300
- 这让人吃惊 那么那些小的RCS推进器用的是什么燃料
- That's amazing, and what do those little RCS thrusters run on? Are they just--

378
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,820
- 冷气体
- Cold gas.

379
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,580
- 冷气体 是吗
- Cold gas, yup?

380
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,120
而这已足够
And that's enough to, I just,

381
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,700
它们小到难以入镜
it's so hard to picture, they're so little.

382
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,780
- 但你只要进入了再入通道 就没事了
- Yeah, but, if you're in the corridor, it's good.

383
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,300
只有在离开再入通道之后 (进行机动时)推力大小这些才是问题
It's only a problem if you get out of the corridor.

384
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,630
再入通道是很狭窄的
So, the corridor is super narrow,

385
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,190
如果你在再入通道外面
and if you kind of get out of corridor,

386
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,460
这个时候等离子体就会回来了
then, that's when the plasma knives come back out,

387
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,620
你只是挨着(超音速)激波的边缘走
and you just trip a shockwave boundary,

388
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,360
贴着这个边 就成功了
and just attach and you're done.

389
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,940
你只需紧跟在那后面
But, if you can just sit in that nice little wake,

390
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,640
跟在巨大的钟形激波后面 那就没问题了
with the big bell shock in front of you, then life's good.

391
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,340
- 你说的这些真令人难以置信
- It's so unbelievable that we're talking about,

392
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,050
现在看起来这很有可能
that's a possibility now, you're just literally sending

393
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,790
你只是把它带回来 通过大气层
it back through the atmosphere, and it's coming in,

394
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,900
尽管回来时 有一部分的温度会达到太阳的水平
there's parts of it that are as hot as the sun,

395
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,770
然后它们还能幸存下来
and they're able to survive.

396
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,630
相比于之前的发射 你是不是必须得在一级(承重)结构之类的地方加了隔热板
And, did you have to beef up heat shield around your structure and stuff like that compared to previous flights?

397
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,950
- 电子的底部(本来)就有一个很大的隔热板
- Well I mean, the bottom of electron has quite a hefty heat shield as it is,

398
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,540
因为(底下)有多个发动机
because of the multiple engines.

399
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,990
有很多羽流效应
You have a lot of plume-plume interaction,

400
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,370
因此 在某些马赫数下 会有很多回流流量
and then, because of that, you have a lot of recirculation flow, especially at certain mach numbers.

401
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,210
所以需要一个性能较好的隔热板
So, the heat shield's pretty decent.

402
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,290
再入的时候我们确实发现隔热板有分裂的情况
You know, on the re-entry we did see the heat shield collapse,

403
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,020
因为隔热板的设计目的并非用于承受那种动态压力
because the heat shield was never designed for those kind of dynamic pressures.

404
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,190
但是我们仍然接收到很稳定的遥测信号
But, you know, we were still receiving solid telemetry,

405
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,570
储罐仍在加压状态 系统仍有响应 遥测信号一直维持到坠毁
the tanks were still pressed, systems still responding, telemetry right to impact,

406
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,000
不过确实失去了几个传感器的信号
and yeah we lost a couple of data acquisition modules,

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,230
包括一些隔热板上的传感器 但也就仅此而已了
and some sensors on the heat shield, but that was it.

408
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,110
- 哇 那么你觉得它 -
- Wow, so you think it was--

409
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,460
- 我认为这是在良好的状态
- I think it was in good shape.

410
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:53,780
- 哇
- Wow.

411
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,090
- 所有的数据都显示 这是出奇地好
- Yeah, yeah, all the data would show that it was in remarkably good shape.

412
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,180
- 所以你还会这样做一遍吗
- Really, so you're going to do that again, basically the same thing?

413
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,330
- 是的 我没想到第10次飞行是如此成功
- Well I didn't expect flight 10 to be so successful,

414
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,230
我觉得这些东西可能比较难以建模和预测
so I figured that with all of these things, you know, it's so hard to model and predict,

415
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,980
从一些小错误中学习并借鉴
you get a little thing wrong and then you go and learn from it.

416
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,900
所以 我跟团队说了<i>没事 我们连续做两次(实验)</i>
So, I said to the team, "Right, let's do two in a row, and you know--"

417
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,130
- 确认所有东西
- Confirm everything.

418
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,990
- (收集数据)是第一位的 我们会尽力的
- Yeah first one, we'll try our best,

419
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,250
我们可能会学到很多东西 然后第二次可能就成功了
we'll probably learn a lot, and then we'll might get the second one right.

420
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:30,140
第二次时我们直播可能会开久一点
But, the second time 'round, we'll hold onto the live feed a lot longer in the second time 'round.
注：第11次飞行直播 youtu.be/af-PplDIkbc?t=1113 (吐槽一下av85905439来源有问题打不开然后音画还不同步)

421
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,060
再入时我们是主动地关闭了相机的下行数据传输
We actually intentionally shut the re-entry camera of the line down,

422
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,010
因为我们想保持完整的数据传输链路
because we wanted to maintain the integrity of the data link.

423
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,890
数据是最重要的 尽管图像也很好(但要牺牲一下)
Data is king; images are great, but data is king.

424
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,950
所以我们切换到低带宽模式 并关闭了相机
So, we switched into a low-bandwidth mode, and shut down the camera.

425
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,180
尽管如此 在坠毁之前我们一直保持着1Mbps的速度
But as it was, we maintained one megabit per second link all the way into impact,

426
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,820
所以下次我们可能会一直开着相机
so we'll be able to have good camera on the way in on the next one.

427
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,690
- 哇 所以这是个好消息
- Wow, wow, so that's great news.

428
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:03,860
所以 你尽量把第10次飞行做的事在第11次飞行上重复一遍
So, as far as, so you're going to basically do repeating the thing you just did for flight 10 for flight 11,

429
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,870
那么到第12次飞行的时候你会把超音速气球和降落伞带上吗
then, is that when you start attaching hypersonic balloons and parachutes on flight 12?

430
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:16,770
- 不会是第12次飞行 我们在转向下一阶段之前会做很多工作
- Not flight 12, I expected us to have to do a lot of work before we would move to the next stage.

431
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,460
我们现在还在很初级的阶段
I think we're all in kind of, like, a child giddy mode right now,

432
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,540
因为我们(只是)得到了需要处理的数据
because we've got all the data we needed to proceed,

433
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,930
所以还需要另一部分的升级
so we'll do another block upgrade,

434
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,460
还需要好几次飞行
and that'll probably take us a few flights.

435
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,290
- 真的吗？
- Really?

436
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,940
- 然后我们才会加上降落伞
- And then we'll get some chutes on it.

437
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,480
- 另外 方便的话
- Another, if you don't mind me asking,

438
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,950
还会有什么别的变化吗
what changes are gonna happen?

439
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,660
- 下一个阶段就是加上降落伞了
- Chutes, so we'll get some chutes on the next one.

440
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,530
对于减速装置 我们还有很多事要做
And, you know, we'll still have more work to do with some decelerators,

441
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,230
但最想做的还是加上降落伞
but what I really want to do is get it onto chutes,

442
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,870
能完整地回收 在海里溅落 从里面捞出来 取证并进行分析
get it back in one piece, and in the ocean, go fish it out, and do some forensics on it.

443
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,710
只有实际物理地检查了硬件才能了解最多的东西
That, we'll learn the most by actually physically inspecting the hardware.

444
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:02,810
- 当然 也可能一旦有了更多的空气动力学上的减速装置
- Of course, yeah, so as far as maybe having more aerodynamic decelerators...

445
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,800
有人讨论过那种剥皮一样的中间级设计吗
has there ever been any talk about having the inter-stage kind of, like, peel back
注：类似欧洲版猎鹰9 RETALT(反推辅助降落技术) www.retalt.eu/project/ 但实际上和猎鹰9一样，估计都是亚音速段起作用的

446
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
像开花一样
like some kind of flower petal or anything?
注：类似欧洲版猎鹰9 RETALT(反推辅助降落技术) www.retalt.eu/project/ 但实际上和猎鹰9一样，估计都是亚音速段起作用的

447
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,740
- 实际上 那种东西加到级间端就是加错位置了 信不信由你
- Yeah, actually, the inter-stage is the wrong place you want it, believe it or not.
注：电子不需要亚音速段的控制，因为降落伞和减速气球足够了

448
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,570
- 真的吗？
- Really?

449
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,410
- 是的 这和高超音速流体状态是有一点点不同
- Yeah, it's not, hypersonic flow regime is a little bit different.

450
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,330
- 因为它离激波太远了
- Is it because it ends up out so far outside of the wake it's just almost sitting,

451
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,910
起不了太多作用？
and not doing any effect at all?

452
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,820
- 没错 (再入时)就像打孔一样
- Exactly, because you're punching in,

453
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,820
如果你的再入通道没问题 那么激波(在后部)会比较大
if you get your corridor right you've got a big kind of shadow,

454
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,750
所以 (减速装置放在后面)想要起作用就必须变得很大
so, you end up having to have something something super big to be effective.

455
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,520
- 而这会很蠢
- And that's just dumb.

456
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,970
- 所以你把级间端折叠成花瓣一样
- So if you just, yeah, folded your inter-stage over like petals,

457
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,620
气流不会流过那里
there's just nothing there, there's no flow there.

458
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,330
- 这讲得通
- That makes sense,

459
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,760
所以 你可能有小的折叠型减速板 在需要时从一级结构上弹出吗
so, you could potentially have little, small air brakes pop out of your thrust structure or something?

460
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,600
- 是有各种不同的方法
- Yeah, there's all sorts of different regimes.

461
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,350
- 只是增加一些表面面积
- Just expand that surface area out a little bit more.

462
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,700
- 不同的情况有不同的解决方法
- I mean, different solutions for different courses.

463
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,270
可能更小的攻角会更有效(而不需要减速板这些)
Maybe, if you had a shallower angle of attack, then those would be more effective.

464
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,760
但是 我们所想的是尽量确保一级火箭温度较低并且不要被风压损坏
But, our whole concept here is to keep the stages cool and out of all the wind as possible.

465
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,060
- 所以 只要保持在你的再入通道里面
- So, as far as your flight corridor;

466
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,090
所以你们是希望更长一点的通道 还是陡峭或者垂直往下的
is it better for you guys to come in longer, like, steeper like that, or straight down?

467
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,230
- 这些都与攻角有关
- It's really about angle of attack.

468
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,740
也是我们想尝试维持的参数
That's what we want to try and maintain.

469
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,000
- 因此 我们在2020年可以期待的事情会是：
- So, what we can look forward to in 2020 would be:

470
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,460
增加更多的可重复性使用的硬件 更多次发射
we're going to be looking for more recovery hardware, more flights.

471
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,720
- 发射频率翻番
- Double the flight rate.

472
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,550
- 发射频率翻番
- Double the flight rate,

473
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,380
每月一次？ - 是啊 是啊
once a month? - Yup, yup.

474
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,170
- 哇 从这里进行的发射
- Wow, launches out of here.

475
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,340
- 是的 从这里进行的发射
- Yup, launch out of here.

476
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,170
- 从这里
- (laughs) From right here.

477
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,610
- 是啊 在这个飞行桶里
- Yeah, in this flying bucket.

478
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,250
- 当然我们不想在发射的时候呆在这里
- We won't want to be right here when that happens.

479
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,990
然后 2020年你们有什么期待的呢
And then, anything else you guys are really looking forward to in 2020?

480
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,460
- 光子
- Photon.

481
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,130
对我们而言明年是发射卫星的重要的一年
You know, next year is a big year of the satellite, for us.

482
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,770
我很看好光子 我认为这为整个行业解决了很多问题
You know, I'm super pumped about Photon, I think that solves a lot of problems for the industry,

483
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,800
降低了人们把东西发射入轨的门槛
and really lowers the boundaries and barriers for people to put stuff on orbit.

484
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,900
科学 教育 商业企业
You know, science, and education, commercial business,

485
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,400
(它能为这些领域的需求)解除烦恼
you know, it just removes all of the fuss, that's in space.

486
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,480
明年对我们而言任务很重 (特别是)第一次的光子任务
So, that'll be a big year for us next year, the first Photon mission.

487
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,990
也许我们也会把东西送到月球
And, we'll see, who knows, we might even skid something to the moon.

488
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,460
- 但愿如此
- I hope so.

489
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,420
- 我们走着瞧
- We'll see how it goes.

490
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,440
- 这会很了不起的 谢谢你给我这么多的时间 - 谢谢你 Tim
- That's amazing, well thank you so much for your time - Thanks, Tim!

491
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,750

- and congratulations on this wonderful new launch complex!

492
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,000
- 谢谢你 Tim - 下次再见
- Thanks Tim, appreciate it. - Until next time.

493
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,650
Isn't Peter just awesome?

494
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,950
Thanks to the folks at Rocket Lab for giving me some time

495
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,980

Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.26,0:03:06.53,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}人们一般不必公布上面级的位置
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.54,0:03:08.27,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that's why it was named this way.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.54,0:03:08.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以才会这样命名
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.27,0:03:08.59,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}mm-hmm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.27,0:03:08.59,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}恩
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.03,0:03:10.62,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But again that the Chinese didn't name it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.03,0:03:10.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但同样地 原发射国并没有对此命名
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.20,0:03:13.58,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The catalog comes in the US
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.20,0:03:13.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而目录是US搞的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.86,0:03:19.23,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and with no claim essentially that it's something else that's what the US named it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.86,0:03:19.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而US在起名字的时候基本上不用将其声称为别的什么东西

Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.31,0:03:19.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好吧
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.44,0:03:21.94,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But again it's perfectly in GEO.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.44,0:03:21.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它又是完全在GEO的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.48,0:03:25.06,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you see it's going up and down here. Very very small.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.48,0:03:25.06,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么你看它在这里上上下下 但运动幅度非常非常小
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.96,0:03:26.97,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's really not inclined.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.96,0:03:26.97,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它几乎没有倾角

Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.19,0:03:31.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个非常小的倾角
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.70,0:03:33.90,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}What you would see with an operational satellite.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.70,0:03:33.90,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}就像你在运营中的卫星上看到的那样
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.14,0:03:40.03,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's coplanar meaning it's perfectly in sync with TJS-3.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.14,0:03:40.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}运动轨迹是共面的 意味着它与TJS-3是完全同步的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.56,0:03:44.27,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that also is not necessarily unusual if the two objects came from the same launch.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.56,0:03:44.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这也可能是正常的 如果两个物体是被一起发射的话
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.03,0:03:46.88,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The fact that they're left at the same inclination.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.03,0:03:46.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}事实上 它们的倾角是一样的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.88,0:03:47.36,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.88,0:03:47.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.92,0:03:51.13,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yet you don't leave a dead upper stage here.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.92,0:03:51.13,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是留下的上面级并不是死的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.20,0:03:51.70,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}On purpose.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.20,0:03:51.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且是有意的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.70,0:03:53.40,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that was weird.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.70,0:03:53.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以那是挺怪的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.40,0:03:54.17,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.40,0:03:54.17,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.61,0:03:55.05,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Very weird.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.61,0:03:55.05,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}非常奇怪
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.23,0:04:00.43,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And you see that they are at this instant I paused at 93 kilometers apart from each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.23,0:04:00.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你看 我暂停下来 在这一瞬间 这俩相距93km
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.11,0:04:03.41,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And you'll see that number changes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.11,0:04:03.41,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而你也会看到这个数字的变化
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.67,0:04:07.93,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And so what I'm dragging through January here if you watch the clock in the lower left
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.67,0:04:07.93,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么看下左下角的时钟 我现在把时间拖过1月份
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.21,0:04:08.88,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you see what's happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.21,0:04:08.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你会看到发生了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.88,0:04:09.96,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They're drifting drifting.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.88,0:04:09.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们正在漂移
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.15,0:04:11.03,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now by this time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.15,0:04:11.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么在这个时候
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.03,0:04:13.24,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I kind of went right over it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.03,0:04:13.24,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}时间拖得有点过度了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.86,0:04:20.01,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}January 4th we saw this AKM thing do a maneuver so that was unusual.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.86,0:04:20.01,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}1月4日 我们看到这个AKM做了一个机动 那么这是不寻常的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.53,0:04:22.41,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then January 10th it did another maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.53,0:04:22.41,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后在1月10日 它又做了一次机动
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.41,0:04:29.47,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So again if it was an upper stage a spent upper stage from a end of December mission.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.41,0:04:29.47,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 如果它是一个在之前12月底任务中失效的上面级
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.04,0:04:32.21,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's no way it's doing maneuvers on January 4th and 10th.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.04,0:04:32.21,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它是不可能在1月4日和10日做机动的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.78,0:04:35.13,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that also got our attention.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.78,0:04:35.13,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这也引起了我们的注意
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.13,0:04:38.36,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So now I have a couple things to say this is not an AKM.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.13,0:04:38.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么现在我有几件事要说 此AKM非彼AKM
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.53,0:04:40.82,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We also looked at the photometric (heat chart)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.53,0:04:40.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们也看了光度(热图)……
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.83,0:04:43.87,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and those maneuvers were not to give it an inclination to get out of the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.83,0:04:43.87,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这些机动并不是为了让它得到倾角 以离开此地
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.18,0:04:44.56,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Right right.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.18,0:04:44.56,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}对对对
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.56,0:04:48.62,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They were basically station-keeping maneuvers to adjust the the east-west drift.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.56,0:04:48.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}基本上 它们是在进行保位机动 以抵消东西向的漂移
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.89,0:04:51.04,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Notice how these guys are staying kind of in sync.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.89,0:04:51.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}注意这些家伙是如何保持同步的

Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.74,0:04:57.40,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now Bob is scrubbing through time if you can see his mouse.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.74,0:04:57.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么Bob在擦动时间条 如果你能看到他的鼠标
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.40,0:04:59.33,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}My mouse is on bottom so I'm going backwards or forwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.40,0:04:59.33,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我的鼠标在画面的底部 那么我在往后或往前走
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.72,0:05:04.43,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So now we're around January 19th
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.72,0:05:04.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么现在我们到了1月19日左右
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.98,0:05:07.93,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and on Saturday the AKM move his wheel.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.98,0:05:07.93,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在周六 AKM进行了它的机动
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.02,0:05:08.81,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's going somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.02,0:05:08.81,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它要去某个地方了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.42,0:05:12.25,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it moved over about a tenth of a degree
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.42,0:05:12.25,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它移动了大约0.1度
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.91,0:05:15.90,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and two days later on Monday TJS-3 followed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.91,0:05:15.90,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}两天后的周一 TJS-3也跟着来了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.35,0:05:20.66,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this is but one of many examples where these two guys are operating in concert.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.35,0:05:20.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这不过是这两个家伙协同行动的众多例子之一
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.89,0:05:26.52,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There whatever TJS-3 is which again unannounced whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.89,0:05:26.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不管TJS-3是什么 当然 再说一下 TJS-3的任务并没有被公布
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.12,0:05:30.74,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This other thing this Mysteries object they're acting in concert.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.33,0:05:35.36,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And so you're going to see they slide to the east a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.33,0:05:35.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以你会看到它们向东边滑行了一点
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.14,0:05:40.45,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then they both do a station keeping maneuver almost at the same time to go back to the West
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.14,0:05:40.45,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后它们几乎在同一时间做了一个保位的机动 回到了西边
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.47,0:05:45.50,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because in this part of the the GEO belt, the forces are such
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.47,0:05:45.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为在GEO的这片区域上 存在这样的力
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.50,0:05:49.66,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that your satellite will the accelerations to the east.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.50,0:05:49.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}会使你的卫星向东加速
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.16,0:05:53.45,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you do a maneuver to kick it west and it turns around
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.16,0:05:53.45,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么你做了一个机动动作 把卫星踢到西边 它就转过来了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.14,0:05:55.94,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you keep doing that over and over again.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.14,0:05:55.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而你会这样一直做(来保持位置)
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.25,0:05:57.52,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that's what these guys kept doing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.25,0:05:57.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这两个家伙也一直在做
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.13,0:06:01.59,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So I'm going back and forth and back to establish relationship between these two guys.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.13,0:06:01.59,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么(在时间的加速下) 这两者一直在这样徘徊 建立了某种联系
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.17,0:06:06.50,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Notice the range is generally around 100 km or so.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.17,0:06:06.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}注意范围一般在100公里左右
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.05,0:06:08.83,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they're not over tight.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.05,0:06:08.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以它们并没有靠得太近
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.40,0:06:11.50,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They're not doing a rendezvous and prox ops(proximity operations).
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.40,0:06:11.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它们没有进行交会以及抵近操作(prox ops)

Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.98,0:06:17.43,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So at this point TJS-3 does its maneuver to kind of half the distance.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.98,0:06:17.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么在此时 TJS-3机动到两者距离的一半
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.89,0:06:22.69,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And again look they're operating in perfect concert station-keeping together.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.89,0:06:22.69,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且同样地 会看到它们在完美地协同行动 一起进行保位
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.32,0:06:28.06,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they've got this established pattern of doing something together.

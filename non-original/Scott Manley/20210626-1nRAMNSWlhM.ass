Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.82,0:03:02.78,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但那些实际上并不作为控制面工作
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.81,0:03:04.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,They don't move. They don't actuate.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.81,0:03:04.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,它们不移动 它们不启动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.47,0:03:08.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,And again of course you have to worry about symmetry.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.47,0:03:08.05,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,当然 你还得担心对称性问题

Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.47,0:03:56.28,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Because players began building rockets so large that they would just clip through that tower and explode on spawning.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.47,0:03:56.28,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为玩家们开始把火箭造得太大了 以至于它们会直接穿过发射塔并在产卵时爆炸

Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.14,0:01:20.86,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is after all an alpha release
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.14,0:01:20.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这毕竟是一个最初的版本
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.19,0:01:24.51,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}six months after they started developing the game.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.26,0:01:38.30,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有趣的是 直到一年前它们的贴花才真正出现在了游戏中
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.66,0:01:42.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But you have a little command pod there.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.66,0:01:42.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在这里 你有一个小小的指令舱
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.98,0:01:44.72,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And you could start assembling bits on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.98,0:01:44.72,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并且你可以开始在上面装配部件
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.74,0:01:47.19,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So put a stack decoupler under there.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.74,0:01:47.19,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以 让我们在那下面放一个分离器
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.73,0:01:50.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Put ourselves Rocket engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.73,0:01:50.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}给我们的航天器装上火箭发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.61,0:01:54.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And underneath that well we probably need to move the whole thing upward.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.61,0:01:54.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在这下面 好吧我们现在可能需要把整个东西往上移
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.46,0:01:55.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Well at least that works.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.46,0:01:55.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好吧 至少向上移动的操作奏效了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.97,0:01:59.78,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's a lot of stuff in this that you expect to work if you've played the game
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.97,0:01:59.78,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你玩过这个游戏 你会期待这里面许多操作能奏效
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.06,0:02:03.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which doesn't actually work because it wasn't implemented.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.06,0:02:03.91,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但实际上 很多这些操作有时并不会奏效 因为(在代码里)没有被实现
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.81,0:02:10.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Let's put an FL-T500 in here.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.22,0:02:14.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now you'll notice I'm doing one tank here and not multiple tanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.22,0:02:14.55,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在你会注意到 我在这里只放了一个而非多个燃料箱
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.96,0:02:21.01,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The reason is back in this very earliest version only one tank could feed one engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.96,0:02:21.01,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是因为 在早期版本中 一个发动机只能由一个燃料箱提供燃料
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.13,0:02:25.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you couldn't stack tanks the way that we're all used to these days.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.13,0:02:25.56,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以 你不能像我们现在所习惯的那样堆放燃料箱
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.15,0:02:28.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Let's do this.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.15,0:02:28.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}让我们现在这样做
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.04,0:02:30.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we'll do another tank.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.04,0:02:30.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后我们再放一个燃料箱
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.43,0:02:33.61,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we'll also try to put some radial boosters on right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.43,0:02:33.61,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们还将尝试安装一些径向助推器 对吗
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.13,0:02:38.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So Radial Decouplers are things you attached to the side.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.13,0:02:38.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 径向分离器是你要安装到火箭侧面的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.87,0:02:40.93,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And in this version there's no symmetry.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.87,0:02:40.93,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在这个版本中 没有对称功能
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.00,0:02:46.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You just have to sort of guess where it is and slap them on there.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.00,0:02:46.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你只能猜测它的位置 然后把它们安在上面
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.60,0:02:50.33,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And hope that they are lined up sufficiently well
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.60,0:02:50.33,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并希望它们能完全排成一行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.38,0:02:54.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that they don't actually spin you off and cause you to fall over.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.38,0:02:54.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}以免它们造成火箭旋转 使火箭倾倒
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.43,0:02:59.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There are also little fins there
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.43,0:02:59.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这里还有一些小翼面
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.82,0:03:02.78,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but those don't actually work as control surfaces.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.82,0:03:02.78,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但实际上 它们并不是操纵面
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.81,0:03:04.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They don't move. They don't actuate.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.81,0:03:04.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它们不会移动 也不能被驱动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.47,0:03:08.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And again of course you have to worry about symmetry.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.47,0:03:08.05,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 你还得担心对称问题
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.51,0:03:10.22,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}No aerodynamic nosecone
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.51,0:03:10.22,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这个版本里没有空气动力鼻锥
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.26,0:03:15.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because well the aerodynamics in this game are very primitive at this time
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.26,0:03:15.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这个游戏的空气动力学在那时还是非常原始的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.36,0:03:19.32,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so I can actually adjust the staging here which is great.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.36,0:03:19.32,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以我实际上可以再这里调整分级 这点很好
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.21,0:03:22.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}One thing I haven't put on is the parachute
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.21,0:03:22.30,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有一个东西我还没有装上 那就是降落伞
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.32,0:03:27.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you'll notice in the description that it still has that comedic outlook on life.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.32,0:03:27.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并且你会注意到在它的描述中 仍饱含那种喜剧性的人生观
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.86,0:03:32.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Widely accepted this is a better alternative to being in free fall.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.86,0:03:32.14,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这个降落伞被广泛认为是比自由落体更好的选择

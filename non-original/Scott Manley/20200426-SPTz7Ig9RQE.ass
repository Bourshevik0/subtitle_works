Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.08,0:00:05.37,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Hello it's Scott Manley here.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.58,0:00:09.11,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}A few days ago Iran managed to launch a satellite into space
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.13,0:00:14.65,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and this was notable because it was their first successful launch in quite a few attempts.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.09,0:00:20.10,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The big difference was that this was a launch by their military, the Republican Guard
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.10,0:00:22.59,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}rather than their civilian space program.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.93,0:00:25.14,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was a lot of similarities in launch vehicle.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.14,0:00:27.11,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This was officially called the Qased.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.73,0:00:32.84,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But the first stage of that is essentially a derivative of the shahab-3 missile
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.89,0:00:36.69,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which itself is based on the North Korean Nodong missile.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.46,0:00:40.05,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's also a version of this that is made by Pakistan.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.05,0:00:46.05,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But they are all basically an upgraded Scud with an engine which is about 40% bigger.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.55,0:00:50.25,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now the engine isn't simply a scaled up Scud engine as far as we know.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.25,0:00:54.03,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It turns out that this engine was developed in the Soviet Union
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.03,0:01:00.52,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and probably traveled to North Korea along with Soviet scientists after the end of the Cold War.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.17,0:01:04.88,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Either way it's estimated that it produces maybe about 30 tons of thrust.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.28,0:01:08.90,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Steering is through a vane system in the fuel outlet.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.11,0:01:10.89,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now as for what the propellant is used.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.48,0:01:13.04,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is what the exhaust looks like.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.61,0:01:17.77,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And more sources believe that it uses the Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.84,0:01:20.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}A term which I love to use because it makes me feel smarter.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.96,0:01:30.24,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And something called AK27 which is believed to be 27% Dinitrogen Tetroxide and the rest is Nitric Acid.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.02,0:01:33.57,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If it was using a hundred percent Nitrogen Tetroxide,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.60,0:01:36.21,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}we would probably see the characteristic orange smoke.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.41,0:01:37.09,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We don't see that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.11,0:01:41.75,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's brown instead which leads us to believe there's the lower concentration.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.11,0:01:47.94,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is of course social media video supposedly showing recovered debris from the first stage
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.95,0:01:49.64,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that obviously the first stage broke up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.04,0:01:54.11,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This engine, we don't know for sure, but this is roughly the right size.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.15,0:02:00.09,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It looks like every other engine we've seen and I mean this is very clearly a rocket engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.09,0:02:01.68,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's roughly the right size.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.74,0:02:04.61,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It has the regeneratively cooled chamber.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.61,0:02:08.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see the injector plate which matches existing debris that we found
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.04,0:02:11.76,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and I believe it's in the correct place.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.22,0:02:15.40,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The facility where they've been doing this testing is Shahrud
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.41,0:02:17.64,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the place where the debris was found is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.64,0:02:22.92,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}yeah right in line with where the orbit would have expected to be based upon the orbital elements.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.53,0:02:28.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now it did launch from a mobile launch vehicle but it was from a facility where they'd been doing testing.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.86,0:02:35.34,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Also I note that (at) the door there there is a little plastic lawn chair that they're using for their launch center.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.57,0:02:38.55,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm not sure if there was actually somebody in there pushing a button.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.93,0:02:43.08,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But if they were then during the launch you actually see that the door blows open.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.20,0:02:47.01,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So I'm not sure the person cared about the quality of their plastic garden chair.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.21,0:02:53.10,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}After all he did decide that plastic garden chairs were perfectly good for the VIPs as long as they were blue.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.86,0:02:58.24,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Anyway the initial drone images actually tell us a lot about the dimensions and size
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.26,0:03:02.36,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it's very much consistent with being a Shahab-3 derivative.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.42,0:03:08.29,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You know the drone flies around gives us lots of different angles, lots of information.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.76,0:03:12.33,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Also note this shot is reverse because that person is walking backwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.76,0:03:15.99,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But that shot did give us a good look at the mission patch
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.06,0:03:21.28,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and from that we can see it's pretty much a 6U CubeSat with solar panels
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.32,0:03:25.17,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it's observing Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.64,0:03:31.65,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was a tweet by General Jay Raymond from Space Force who identified as a 3Us CubeSat
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.65,0:03:33.66,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but I'm gonna presume that is a mistake.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.66,0:03:36.39,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's a mistake either this. He stated the wrong thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.39,0:03:42.47,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Or he's accidentally revealed that Space Force can tell the difference between a 6U and a 3U CubeSat.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.42,0:03:45.84,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Anyway we will talk more about the satellite in a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.84,0:03:49.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But what I want to talk about is the most interesting part of this mission.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.70,0:03:50.85,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's not the satellite.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.85,0:03:52.04,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's not the booster.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.58,0:03:54.08,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's the second stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.34,0:03:59.71,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The second stage is something which I believe is kind of new for Iran.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.35,0:04:03.69,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yeah we get the staging. I don't know how fast it's going.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.69,0:04:06.32,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it's up high enough that it's outside the atmosphere.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.66,0:04:09.09,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then the second stage kicks in.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.09,0:04:15.46,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The second stage is almost certainly a solid rocket motor based on a new design.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.93,0:04:19.82,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The infrared camera shows us it's a solid motor because you can see a glow
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.82,0:04:23.72,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you generally can't see that unless you have particles in the exhaust
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.48,0:04:29.13,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this solid booster is known as Salman and they actually announced it earlier in the year.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.13,0:04:33.75,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We have test footage showing it demonstrating its thrust vectoring technology.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.00,0:04:38.01,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This test doesn't have a nozzle extension because it's being performed at sea level.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.41,0:04:43.24,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We also have like interviews and presentations showing this piece of hardware
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.26,0:04:45.21,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they're rightfully proud of this.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.21,0:04:49.53,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is a much more high-tech piece of hardware than that first stage booster.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.98,0:04:53.10,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see the nozzle extension, the thrust vectoring hardware.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.10,0:04:57.38,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They explained that this is a filament wound carbon fiber casing.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.86,0:04:59.19,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So now you've seen that isolated.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.19,0:05:03.42,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's easy to see where it is on the rocket with the fairing sitting on top of it
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.73,0:05:07.02,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the interstage adapter to the rest of the rocket below that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.02,0:05:08.85,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The nozzle extends down into that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.31,0:05:11.98,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And when of course you see the video, it's really obvious.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.37,0:05:15.57,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And while people have been measuring this and estimating the performance,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.57,0:05:21.51,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the video literally goes ahead and includes a screen shot which shows us the performance and everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.83,0:05:22.89,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So what do we see here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.89,0:05:24.54,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Well the first thing is on the right,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.54,0:05:28.94,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}we actually get a whole bunch of numbers telling us where the spacecraft is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.82,0:05:31.41,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}What we have is T for time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.41,0:05:32.60,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}(V for) velocity.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.67,0:05:34.31,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}H is current altitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.33,0:05:38.01,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I believe X is the down range and y might be a cross range coordinate.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.01,0:05:42.96,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Ha is height of Apogee and Hp is height of perigee.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.41,0:05:47.92,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is before it has achieved orbit because perigee is a negative value.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.48,0:05:51.96,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}These numbers indicate that it's still going up towards Apogee
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.96,0:05:55.51,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then presumably that will be when it fires the third stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.04,0:05:57.96,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And elsewhere we can see confirmation of this
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.96,0:06:05.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because those graphs in the top right there, there's one of them which appears to show the velocity over time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.16,0:06:09.83,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that's one in the bottom left, you can see that it rises up initially
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.85,0:06:12.36,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then it flattens out during the staging.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.79,0:06:18.42,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Then the second stage kicks off and raises the speed to as we see about 5.2 kilometers per second.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.70,0:06:22.23,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then there's another sort of constant velocity cruise.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.46,0:06:25.41,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's where it's rising up towards the apogee
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.64,0:06:29.04,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then that mysterious third stage will light up
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.04,0:06:34.29,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and actually if you look at that you can just see that it seems to have quite a steep ascent there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.29,0:06:37.60,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so I think the third stage is probably relatively powerful
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.64,0:06:39.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but we don't actually know what it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.26,0:06:45.51,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Some but people say this their rash 24 which was designed for the Simorgh I believe
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.84,0:06:48.93,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but that doesn't make sense for this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.93,0:06:53.37,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because they actually tell us in an interview that is a liquid-fueled upper stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.01,0:06:58.35,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Finally the one other screen I can really understand given that I don't speak Farsi
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.35,0:07:05.97,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}is this one which shows 6 thrusters and it appears to show a tank with two separate sections in it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.20,0:07:08.69,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So those look like six bipropellant thrusters
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.72,0:07:11.92,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that are probably used for attitude control during the cruise phase.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.56,0:07:17.12,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm not clear if there's another larger engine that's used for orbital insertion
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.52,0:07:19.92,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but I guess the most interesting thing is the sign
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.92,0:07:24.69,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that it's a split tank showing that they're using bipropellant reaction control thrusters.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.54,0:07:28.35,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's all hidden inside the fairing so we can't really guess
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.37,0:07:30.27,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but honestly it's not that interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.30,0:07:36.69,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The real thing here to look at is their relatively large solid propellant motor.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.87,0:07:38.58,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because that's really what they've been going for.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.58,0:07:40.11,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's what they've been developing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.43,0:07:42.65,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that test stand that we saw earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.89,0:07:44.88,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's the smallest test stand they built.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.88,0:07:52.02,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There are several larger test stands which could handle solid motors with thrusts up to 200 tonnes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.81,0:07:53.97,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So back to the payload.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.97,0:07:58.65,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The newer spacecraft has been picked up by amateurs all over the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.00,0:08:04.16,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it seems to be using off-the-shelf you know CubeSat hardware and protocols.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.73,0:08:08.49,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The packets have been decoded by some being confirmed
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.49,0:08:11.08,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that it is in the correct orbit that was declared.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.61,0:08:14.19,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And yes it does appear to be slowly tumbling right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.62,0:08:18.45,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Many CubeSats do this for the first few days as they slowed things down.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.74,0:08:24.36,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That being said Space Command has characterized this as a tumbling webcam in space.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.70,0:08:29.13,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Then again, any visual system is practically a webcam in space
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.14,0:08:32.16,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}compared to the largest satellites that the NRO has put up.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.83,0:08:34.35,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it's not competing with those.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.36,0:08:37.29,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It would be competing with the Dove CubeSats
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.32,0:08:41.40,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which are 3U CubeSats with that are entirely devoted to imaging.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.87,0:08:46.12,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And really the problem here is the form factor limits your focal length.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.35,0:08:51.56,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they may very well have a camera in there is comparable to the Dove CubeSats
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.58,0:08:58.44,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but why wouldn't they just work through some third party to buy access to planets, you know, at data.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.27,0:09:01.37,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the answer is it's about the rocket.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.37,0:09:03.83,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's about demonstrating the launch capability.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.49,0:09:09.76,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The data that they will get from this satellite will very likely be available from public sources.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.18,0:09:15.11,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But those sources wouldn't be able to demonstrate Iran's launch vehicle technology
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.11,0:09:22.57,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}in particular the second stage which we believe is the first step in building larger and larger solid rocket motors.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.12,0:09:26.18,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}What I wonder is what this means for their civilian launch program.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.18,0:09:28.33,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}after the all they've had several failures
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.37,0:09:31.85,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and one of which was of course publicized by President Trump
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.85,0:09:36.71,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}revealing all sorts of fascinating details about Iranian space program
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.76,0:09:40.13,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and US spy satellite capabilities in his tweets.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.86,0:09:44.25,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I believe the Safir launch vehicle has reached the end of its line
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.27,0:09:48.74,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the civilian program wants to go with Simorgh but that hasn't had huge successes.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.08,0:09:52.06,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I don't think Qased will get a great deal of use
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.12,0:09:56.05,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because of course they're wanting to replace the first stage with the solid rocket.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.18,0:10:01.37,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And if they do that then that will be a very big leap forward for Iran's space technology.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.96,0:10:04.24,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm Scott Manley. Fly safe.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.13,0:00:14.65,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这次值得注意的是 这是他们在多次发射尝试中的首次成功
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.09,0:00:20.10,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最大的不同是 这是由他们的军队 共和国卫队进行的发射
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.10,0:00:22.59,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而不是他们的民用航天计划
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.93,0:00:25.14,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在火箭上有很多相似之处
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.14,0:00:27.11,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它被正式地称为Qased
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.73,0:00:32.84,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它的第一级基本上是流星3导弹的衍生品
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.89,0:00:36.69,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}本身就是以朝鲜的芦洞导弹为基础的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.46,0:00:40.05,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}还有一种是巴基斯坦制造的版本
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.05,0:00:46.05,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它们基本上都是升级版的飞毛腿导弹 引擎比它大40%左右
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.55,0:00:50.25,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在据我们所知 这个发动机并不是简单地放大了的飞毛腿发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.25,0:00:54.03,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}原来这种发动机是在苏联研制的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.03,0:01:00.52,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并可能在冷战结束后与苏联科学家一起前往了朝鲜
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.17,0:01:04.88,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}无论如何 估计它产生的推力大概有30吨
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.28,0:01:08.90,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}矢量推进是通过喷管末端的燃气舵来进行的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.11,0:01:10.89,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么至于推进剂是什么
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.48,0:01:13.04,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是尾气的样子
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.61,0:01:17.77,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}更多的消息来源认为 它使用的是非对称二甲基肼(偏二甲肼)
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.84,0:01:20.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样说全称可以让我显得很聪明

Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.02,0:01:33.57,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果是用百分之百的四氧化二氮
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.60,0:01:36.21,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们可能会看到特有的橙色烟雾
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.41,0:01:37.09,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我们没看到
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.11,0:01:41.75,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且是橙色的 这说明可能是更低浓度的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.11,0:01:47.94,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这当然是流传在社交媒体上的视频 据称是一级火箭上回收到的残骸
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.95,0:01:49.64,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很明显 一级火箭(的残骸)解体了

Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.53,0:02:28.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 它确实是由移动载具发射的 但这也是他们一直进行测试的地方(而没有进行转运)
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.86,0:02:35.34,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}另外我还注意到(在)发射中心门口有一个小塑料草坪椅
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.57,0:02:38.55,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不确定那里是否真的有人在按下按钮
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.93,0:02:43.08,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但如果他们在里面 那么在发射过程中 你就会看到门被炸开了 (应该会很糟糕吧)
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.20,0:02:47.01,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以我不确定那个人是否在乎他们的塑料花园椅的质量
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.21,0:02:53.10,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}毕竟他确实决定了塑料花园椅只要是蓝色的 就完全可以给VIP使用
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.86,0:02:58.24,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}总之最初的无人机画面其实告诉了我们很多关于尺寸和大小的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.26,0:03:02.36,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且它非常类似于流星3的衍生品
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.42,0:03:08.29,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}飞来飞去的无人机给了我们很多不同的角度 很多信息

Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.65,0:03:33.66,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我要假设这是一个错误
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.66,0:03:36.39,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}比如他说错了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.39,0:03:42.47,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}或者是他不小心透露了美国太空军可以分辨6U和3U的立方星的区别
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.42,0:03:45.84,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}总之 关于卫星的问题 我们稍后再谈
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.84,0:03:49.70,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我想说的是这次任务中最有趣的部分
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.70,0:03:50.85,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不是卫星
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.85,0:03:52.04,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也不是助推器
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.58,0:03:54.08,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而是二级
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.34,0:03:59.71,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}伊朗人研发了全新的二级
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.35,0:04:03.69,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以 是的 我们看到了分级画面 我不知道它的速度有多快
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.69,0:04:06.32,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它的高度足以让它处在大气层外
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.66,0:04:09.09,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后二级就开始运行了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.09,0:04:15.46,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}二级火箭几乎可以肯定是使用了从头制造的固体火箭发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.93,0:04:19.82,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}红外相机显示这是一个固体发动机 因为可以看到光晕
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.82,0:04:23.72,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}光晕一般意味着尾气里有颗粒

Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.37,0:05:15.57,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当人们还在测量这个并估计性能的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.57,0:05:21.51,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}视频直接往前走了 包含一个屏幕的镜头 这向我们展示了性能以及其他东西
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.83,0:05:22.89,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 我们在这里看到了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.89,0:05:24.54,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么首先是右边
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.54,0:05:28.94,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}实际上有一大堆航天器的数据 告诉我们它在哪儿
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.82,0:05:31.41,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}比如T是时间
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.41,0:05:32.60,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}(V代表)速度
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.67,0:05:34.31,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}H是当前高度
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.33,0:05:38.01,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我觉得X是轨道水平方向距离 Y可能是一个横向距离的坐标
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.01,0:05:42.96,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Ha是远地点的高度 Hp是近地点的高度
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.41,0:05:47.92,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这个画面拍摄于它入轨之前 因为近地点是一个负值
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.48,0:05:51.96,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些数字表明它还在向远地点上升
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.96,0:05:55.51,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}大概之后就是它启动三级的时间
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.04,0:05:57.96,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在其他地方 我们可以确认这一点
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.96,0:06:05.70,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为在右上角的那些图中 有一张图显示了速度随时间的变化
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.16,0:06:09.83,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}左下角的那张图 你可以看到它最初是上升的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.85,0:06:12.36,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后 在分级时变得平坦
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.79,0:06:18.42,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}接着二级启动 将速度提高到我们看到的5.2km/s
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.70,0:06:22.23,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}随后是另一种恒速滑行
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.46,0:06:25.41,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那时它会向远地点滑行
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.64,0:06:29.04,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后那个神秘的三级就启动了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.04,0:06:34.29,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而实际上你仔细看的话 好像就会看到一个相当陡峭向上的曲线
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.29,0:06:37.60,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以我觉得三级火箭推力可能比较大
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.64,0:06:39.70,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我们实际上不知道它是什么
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.26,0:06:45.51,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有些人说这是为凤凰火箭研制的rash(?) 24上面级
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.84,0:06:48.93,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这并不合理
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.93,0:06:53.37,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为其实他们在采访中告诉我们 这是一个使用液体燃料的上面级
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.01,0:06:58.35,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最后尽管我不懂波斯语 但还有一个屏幕我真的能看懂
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.35,0:07:05.97,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这个屏幕显示了6个推进器 而且似乎是一个燃料储罐 它有两个独立的部分

Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.52,0:07:19.92,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我想最有趣的是这个标志
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.92,0:07:24.69,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个分体式储罐 表明他们使用的是双组元反推力发动机(RCS)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.54,0:07:28.35,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这一切都隐藏在整流罩内 所以我们无法猜测
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.37,0:07:30.27,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但说实话 这并没有那么有趣
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.30,0:07:36.69,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}真正值得关注的是他们相对较大的固体火箭发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.87,0:07:38.58,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这才是他们一直追求的目标

Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.43,0:07:42.65,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}还有就是我们之前看到的那个试验台
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.89,0:07:44.88,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那是他们建造的最小的试验台
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.88,0:07:52.02,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}还有几个更大的试验台 可以处理推力达200吨推力的固体发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.81,0:07:53.97,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么回到有效载荷的问题上
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.97,0:07:58.65,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}新航天器的信号已经被全世界的业余(无线电)爱好者接收到了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.00,0:08:04.16,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它似乎使用了现成的立方星硬件和协议
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.73,0:08:08.49,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有些数据包已被解码
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.49,0:08:11.08,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其中的信息被确认是它正处于它宣布的正确的轨道上
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.61,0:08:14.19,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 它现在的确在缓慢地翻滚
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.62,0:08:18.45,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}许多立方星在头几天减慢(翻滚)速度时都会这样做
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.74,0:08:24.36,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}话虽如此 但美国太空司令部已经将其定性为太空中翻滚的网络摄像头
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.70,0:08:29.13,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不过话说回来 任何视觉系统实际上都是太空中的摄像头
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.14,0:08:32.16,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在把它们与NRO拿出的最大卫星进行比较时
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.83,0:08:34.35,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它不需要和那些大卫星进行比较
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.36,0:08:37.29,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它的比较对象是鸽子立方星
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.32,0:08:41.40,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一种3U的成像立方星
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.87,0:08:46.12,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}问题在于外形尺寸限制了你的焦距
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.35,0:08:51.56,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们很有可能在那里安装了一个可以和鸽子立方星相媲美的摄像头 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.58,0:08:58.44,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但他们为什么不通过第三方购买比如行星实验室的数据呢
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.27,0:09:01.37,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}答案是火箭
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.37,0:09:03.83,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这能验证发射能力
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.49,0:09:09.76,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们从这颗卫星上获得的数据 很有可能也能从公共资源中获得
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.18,0:09:15.11,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这些资源无法验证伊朗的运载火箭技术
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.11,0:09:22.57,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}特别是二级 我们认为这是建造更大的固体火箭发动机的第一步
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.12,0:09:26.18,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想知道的是 这对他们的民用发射计划的意义
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.18,0:09:28.33,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在他们经历了几次失败之后
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.37,0:09:31.85,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而其中一个当然是由特朗普总统公开的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.85,0:09:36.71,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这条推特揭秘了伊朗太空计划的各种迷人细节

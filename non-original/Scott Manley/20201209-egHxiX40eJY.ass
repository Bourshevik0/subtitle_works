Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.02,0:01:38.64,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And at 1.3 seconds the engines stopped the ignition process.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.02,0:01:38.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在倒计时1.3秒时 发动机停止了点火过程
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.64,0:01:42.96,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Apparently there was a problem with the actual ignition inside the engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.64,0:01:42.96,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}显然是发动机内部的点火装置出了问题
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.96,0:01:47.05,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they decided not to launch and that was an entirely an automated process.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.96,0:01:47.05,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们决定不发射 而这完全是一个自动化的过程
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.15,0:01:50.47,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}On wednesday they got started a little bit earlier

Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.47,0:01:54.32,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but then two minutes before launch they called a hold.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.47,0:01:54.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在发射前两分钟 他们在呼号中暂停了发射{\s1}他们说停停{\s0}
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.32,0:01:57.61,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it took them an hour and a half to ultimately recycle the vehicle.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.32,0:01:57.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而之后 他们花了一个半小时才让航天器恢复发射状态
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.88,0:02:01.00,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And this was the third attempt and it flew obviously.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.88,0:02:01.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在这第三次尝试中 显然它飞了起来
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.20,0:02:04.99,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now we didn't actually know how it was going to perform its flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.20,0:02:04.99,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我们并不知道它将如何进行飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.43,0:02:10.16,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now we did know that the mission plan was to carry the vehicle up to 12.5 kilometers
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.43,0:02:10.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我们知道任务计划是将航天器带到12.5公里的高空
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.16,0:02:14.81,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then have it belly flop back down at terminal velocity before performing the landing.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.16,0:02:14.81,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后让它做机腹翻转机动 以终端速度返回下降 再进行着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.52,0:02:19.12,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But we didn't actually know how it would fly to 12.5 kilometers
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.52,0:02:19.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我们其实并不知道它是如何飞到12.5公里的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.12,0:02:21.65,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and turned out that lots of people got it wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.12,0:02:21.65,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}结果发现很多人都搞错了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.92,0:02:26.08,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That little fireball there is because they just shut down one of the engines
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.92,0:02:26.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那个小火球是因为他们刚刚关闭了一台发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.08,0:02:29.85,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and a lot of amateur observers when they saw that thought that was a failure.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.08,0:02:29.85,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很多爱好者看到后都认为那是个失败
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.40,0:02:32.23,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see some fire inside there.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.40,0:02:32.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到里面着了一点火
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.23,0:02:35.02,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's trapped gases from the engine that's just shut down.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.23,0:02:35.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那是刚刚关闭的发动机所产生的滞留气体
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.03,0:02:36.48,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it's totally normal.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.03,0:02:36.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是完全正常的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.95,0:02:38.48,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But we didn't know that at the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.95,0:02:38.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我们当时并不知道这一点
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.48,0:02:42.16,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I mean there was a lot of concerned comments about this going wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.48,0:02:42.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我是指 有很多对此担心的意见 实际上是错的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.16,0:02:44.23,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But ultimately it's clear.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.16,0:02:44.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但最终很清楚
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.23,0:02:46.95,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The plan is that they had reached a certain speed
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.23,0:02:46.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}计划是他们已经达到了一定的速度
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.95,0:02:48.64,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so they were shutting down the engine
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.95,0:02:48.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们要关闭发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:53.59,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so they could cruise upwards towards their altitude while maintaining control
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:53.59,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样他们就可以在保持控制(速度)的情况下朝着目标高度向上飞行了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.59,0:02:58.64,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because the fins don't actually provide that much control
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.59,0:02:58.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为实际上 翼面并没有提供那么多的控制能力
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.64,0:03:01.08,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}except when they're in the belly flop configuration.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.64,0:03:01.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为翼面是在机腹翻转后的(气动)布局下提供控制的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.36,0:03:03.12,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}When they're going straight up like this
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.36,0:03:03.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当飞船像这样直起身子的时候

Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.72,0:03:43.92,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but should result in lower temperatures inside.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.72,0:03:43.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这样的循环会导致其内部的温度较低
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.92,0:03:46.08,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So we're about to shut off the second engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.92,0:03:46.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以我们就要关闭第二台发动机了

Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.13,0:03:55.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}发动机得进行大幅度的矢量摆动 来(让推力的方向)保持在航天器的中心
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.12,0:04:00.32,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they had to shift the entire vehicle over because the center of thrust was now slightly different.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.12,0:04:00.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们得将整个航天器平移 因为现在的推力中心略有不同
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.04,0:04:04.79,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this engine is probably running at below full thrust levels
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.04,0:04:04.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这台发动机可能是在低于满推力水平的情况下运行
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.79,0:04:08.43,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because what they're now doing is they're coming up towards their apogee.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.79,0:04:08.43,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为他们现在要做的是向远地点靠近

Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.79,0:04:11.76,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}看上去更像是在悬停
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.76,0:04:14.68,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They're performing the equivalent of a hop.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.76,0:04:14.68,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们在进行一种类似悬停的机动
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.95,0:04:18.47,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But they're doing it at 12 kilometers.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.95,0:04:18.47,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这可是在12km的高度上
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.47,0:04:20.79,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They're translating sideways.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.47,0:04:20.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们在横向平移
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.79,0:04:23.04,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because when they start coming back down
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.79,0:04:23.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为当飞船开始往回掉落时
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.04,0:04:27.39,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they will actually want to use aerodynamics to control the vehicle and move it around.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.04,0:04:27.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们实际上是想利用空气动力学来控制航天器并使其移动
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.75,0:04:30.40,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they don't want it to be exactly over the launch site
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.75,0:04:30.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们不希望它正好在发射场的上空
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.44,0:04:36.15,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}partly because if there's a failure they just like it to smash into somewhere that hasn't got buildings on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.44,0:04:36.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}部分原因是 如果出现失败 他们想把火箭砸到没有建筑物的地方
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.63,0:04:41.35,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But secondly they want to actually show that they get a cross-range capabilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.63,0:04:41.35,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但其次则是 实际上他们想展示一种横向机动的能力
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.52,0:04:44.40,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yeah that's four minutes that this engine has been running.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.52,0:04:44.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 是的 这台发动机已经运行四分钟了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.40,0:04:47.14,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's the longest we've seen a Raptor running.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.44,0:04:51.61,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Certainly the longest that we've seen one propelling a vehicle in flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.44,0:04:51.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然也是推动航天器飞行的猛禽点火的最长时间
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.08,0:04:56.32,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So if you look at the condensation and puffs of gas that are coming off the bottom there
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.08,0:04:56.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么如果你看一下底部的蒸汽和气体喷出的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.32,0:05:01.23,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you can actually see that this is moving sideways rather than moving vertically now.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.32,0:05:01.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你就会发现这是在横向移动而不是垂直移动了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.91,0:05:06.08,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now all of this flight so far has been fed from the main propellant tanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.91,0:05:06.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么到目前为止 所有的飞行(动力)都是由主推进剂箱提供的(燃料)
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.08,0:05:09.79,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's the tanks that cover most of the volume of the vehicle.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.08,0:05:09.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那就是覆盖了航天器大部分体积的储罐
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.56,0:05:17.03,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This engine is about to turn off and it will then have to perform this transition into the belly flop maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.56,0:05:17.03,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这台发动机即将关闭 然后它就得进行这个过渡到机腹翻转的动作
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.03,0:05:22.63,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it's going to have to flip over and you see actually uses the gimbaling just a little to help it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.03,0:05:22.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么它必须要翻转 实际上你会发现这是用了一点发动机的矢量推进
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.28,0:05:28.63,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And watch the flaps because this has to basically lift these flaps up and down.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.28,0:05:28.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么再看看翼面 因为这基本上是要把这些翼面向上和向下抬起来
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.63,0:05:36.96,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I believe they're actuated by electric motors and they have to kind of get it flying horizontally like a skydiver.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.63,0:05:36.96,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我相信它们是由电动机驱动的 而飞船必须得像跳伞运动员一样水平飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.96,0:05:43.79,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It wants to present the widest cross-section possible so that it falls at the slowest speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.96,0:05:43.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}飞船得要展示出最宽的横截面 这样才能以最慢的速度下降
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.72,0:05:47.44,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is kind of the signature move of Starship.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.72,0:05:47.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这差不多是Starship的招牌动作
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.44,0:05:51.28,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Being able to go side-on and control yourself aerodynamically

Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.52,0:05:55.75,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}means that you can perform re-entry much more quickly
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.52,0:05:55.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}意味着你可以更快地进行再入
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.75,0:06:02.11,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because the thing about re-entry heating is the sharper the curve the more heating you have to contend with.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.75,0:06:02.11,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为在再入加热这个问题上 (外形)曲线越尖锐 你需要应对的热量就越多
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.16,0:06:05.68,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So a wide flat body like this gets less heating
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.16,0:06:05.68,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么像这样一个宽大平坦的外表 得到的热量就较少
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.68,0:06:11.16,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it pushes the shock wave the stagnation layer much further out from the body.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.68,0:06:11.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这样的外形会把激波的停滞层从机身上推离得更远
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.75,0:06:13.75,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So at this point it's falling steadily
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.75,0:06:13.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这时它在稳定地下降
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.75,0:06:18.00,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and according to Elon this is way more than he expected to actually work.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.75,0:06:18.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而根据马一龙的说法 这次试飞实际进行的动作要比他预期的多得多
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.00,0:06:20.52,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This was much more successful so that's a good thing.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.28,0:06:25.36,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}坠落时 它的机头是稍向下的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.36,0:06:29.12,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because I think they want to traverse, glide just a little.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.36,0:06:29.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为我认为他们想让飞船略微滑行一段距离
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.12,0:06:34.01,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It doesn't really glide but it has enough aerodynamic control that it can cross sideways.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.12,0:06:34.01,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这并不是真正的滑行 但通过足够的空气动力学的控制 可以产生横向位移
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.03,0:06:39.60,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now I want you to think about what's going to happen to the propellant in those main tanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.03,0:06:39.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我想让你想想那些主储箱里的推进剂会发生什么
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.60,0:06:44.60,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's all going to fall to the side of the vehicle because the lowest point of the vehicle.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.60,0:06:44.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些推进剂都会落到航天器的侧面 因为那是航天器的最低点
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.03,0:06:48.62,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the propellant is extracted from those tanks
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.03,0:06:48.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而推进剂会从那些储罐中被提取出来

Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.63,0:06:52.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是通过储罐底部 通向航天器的尾部的管道来完成的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.63,0:06:54.47,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So those are now exposed to gas.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.63,0:06:54.47,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这些管道现在都暴露在气体中
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.47,0:06:57.93,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They can't pull fuel from those tanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.47,0:06:57.93,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们不能从这些储罐中抽出燃料
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.24,0:07:01.63,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Instead they have a pair of smaller tanks called header tanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.24,0:07:01.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}相反 他们有一对较小的储罐 叫头部储罐
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.08,0:07:06.88,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Those are supposed to feed the thrusters for the last moments.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.08,0:07:06.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些储罐是在最后时刻给推进器提供燃料的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.88,0:07:12.40,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And what it's going to do is light up these engines and try to transition back into vertical flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.88,0:07:12.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而接下来就是点燃这些发动机 并尝试将航天器的姿态转变到垂直飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.40,0:07:18.63,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And there we go one two and this is where the thing stops being successful.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.40,0:07:18.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 一 二……而成功的试飞就在这里戛然而止了

Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.95,0:11:11.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}甚至可能会使用这个头部储罐来尝试进行一些持续时间较长的测试点火
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.92,0:11:15.76,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the pressurization comes from autogenous pressurization.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.92,0:11:15.76,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么(头部储罐的)加压来自于自生增压
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.76,0:11:21.51,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That means that some of the propellant that goes into the engines is heated by the combustion
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.76,0:11:21.51,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这意味着一些进入发动机的推进剂会通过燃烧室加热
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.51,0:11:25.87,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then they boil that off and send it back into the tanks to provide pressurization.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.51,0:11:25.87,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}汽化 并将其作为加压气体送回储罐中
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.16,0:11:28.61,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And maybe that loop is too long.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.16,0:11:28.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么也许这个循环太长了
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.04,0:11:33.04,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Obviously the engine's lit for long enough that they could demonstrate that transition.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.04,0:11:33.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很明显 足够长的发动机点火时间可以验证这个(机腹翻转)过渡的可行性
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.20,0:11:37.92,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's also possible something about the forces in that transition and the fuel flow
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.20,0:11:37.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也有可能是在那个过渡过程中 受力和燃料流动的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.39,0:11:41.49,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}meant that they weren't able to pressurize the tanks correctly.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.39,0:11:41.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这就意味着他们不能正确地给储罐加压
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.68,0:11:45.04,1080P-sgbd-4u,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's a very dynamic situation and it is a very new maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.68,0:11:45.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个非常动态的情况 也是一个非常新的机动

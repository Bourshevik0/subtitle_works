Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.24,0:07:10.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有趣的是 很明显 他们必须不断地切换摄像机视角
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.96,0:07:15.07,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because people would just stick their feet in the cameras.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.96,0:07:15.07,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为人们会把他们的脚伸进摄像机
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.62,0:07:19.59,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was very limited amount of visibility and motion in this whole thing.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.09,0:07:28.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同样有趣的是 当它上升时 整个东西都在旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.31,0:07:31.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and I think there's actually a technical reason for this
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.31,0:07:31.30,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我认为这实际上有一个技术上的原因
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.34,0:07:33.77,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because you've got these people bumping around inside it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.34,0:07:33.77,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为里面的人在这样撞来撞去

Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.20,0:07:42.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so giving a small slow spin make sure that the people can still appreciate some level of zero G
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.20,0:07:42.26,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以进行慢速的旋转 可以确保人们仍可以感受到某种程度的零重力
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.70,0:07:46.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the capsule won't accidentally be given some sort of tumble

Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.11,0:08:06.90,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but apparently Blue Origin have made over a hundred million dollars already in bookings for flying on this.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.11,0:08:06.90,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs85}但显然 蓝色起源靠这个航天器的发射 已经赚取了超过1亿美元的预订费
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.03,0:08:10.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm not sure where the price gets before I get interested

Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.25,0:08:12.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but all the same it does look fun.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.25,0:08:12.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但同样 它看起来很有趣
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.96,0:08:16.47,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But as a viewer the my favorite part of this flight was
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.96,0:08:16.47,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但作为一个观众 我最喜欢的部分是
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.47,0:08:20.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}when on the way back down the capsule hits the atmosphere

Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.58,0:08:25.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's a lot for an average person.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.58,0:08:25.37,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}对于一个普通人来说 这是很大的
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.08,0:08:28.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we can only hear the audio
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.08,0:08:28.08,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我们只能听到音频
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.08,0:08:29.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and what do we hear during this
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.08,0:08:29.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在这期间我们听到了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.84,0:08:37.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}we hear Wally just whipping with joy that she's handling four and a half Gs just like a pro.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.53,0:08:41.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Remember this is somebody that chose to go through a lot of the astronaut tests on her own
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.53,0:08:41.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}请记住 这是一个选择自己去完成很多宇航员测试的人
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.91,0:08:45.53,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and she ended up having to make her own G-suit.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.91,0:08:45.53,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且那时她不得不自己制作重力服
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.24,0:08:50.72,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Anyway beyond that we've seen it all before there was a post-flight press conference
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.24,0:08:50.72,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}总之 除此之外 我们已经看到了这一切 有一个飞行后的新闻发布会
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.72,0:08:54.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which really was more like an awards ceremony to be honest.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.72,0:08:54.48,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}说实话 这真的更像是一个颁奖仪式
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.48,0:08:57.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The press only got to ask three questions
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.48,0:08:57.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}媒体只问了三个问题
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.29,0:09:02.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and there was a lot of excited descriptions of the experience from the the passengers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.29,0:09:02.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而乘客们对这次经历有很多兴奋的描述
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.73,0:09:08.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was 200 million dollars given to various good causes which was nice
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.73,0:09:08.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有2亿美元捐给了各种慈善事业 这很好
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.98,0:09:11.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but after this it's gonna be down to business
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.98,0:09:11.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在这之后 就会进入正题了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.46,0:09:14.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and I expect there won't be nearly this amount of press attention
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.46,0:09:14.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我本来预计不会有这么多的媒体关注
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.88,0:09:17.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and in fact there will probably be a lot of people
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.88,0:09:17.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但事实上 可能会有很多人
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.86,0:09:22.41,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}who paradoxically want to keep a low profile while going this high.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.86,0:09:22.41,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}矛盾的是 他们想飞这么高的同时保持低调
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.43,0:09:26.20,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They've spent a lot of money on this very unique experience
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.43,0:09:26.20,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们已经花了很多钱在这个非常独特的体验上
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.45,0:09:29.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and perhaps they don't necessarily want to advertise it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.45,0:09:29.74,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而也许他们不一定想宣传它
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.26,0:09:32.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Anyway since we're talking about New Shepherd
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.26,0:09:32.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}无论如何 既然我们在谈论新谢泼德
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.00,0:09:35.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I expect by now a bunch of you have made some comments on its shape
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.00,0:09:35.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想现在你们中的一些人已经对它的形状提出了一些意见
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.83,0:09:37.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is yes rather phallic.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.83,0:09:37.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 相当菲勒斯
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.92,0:09:40.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Let's just say it looks like a penis
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.92,0:09:40.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}就让我们说出来 它像一个皮纳斯
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.95,0:09:45.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And I think it's important that we grab hold of this and give it the love and attention that it needs
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.95,0:09:45.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我认为重要的是 我们要抓住这一点 并给予它所需要的爱和关注
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.83,0:09:49.76,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so this is a result of engineering physics right.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.83,0:09:49.76,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这是一个工程物理学的结果 对吧
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.76,0:09:52.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This was design was arrived at
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.76,0:09:52.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这个设计之所以是这样
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.00,0:09:55.61,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they wanted to perform a certain set of tasks.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.00,0:09:55.61,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是因为他们想执行一系列的任务
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.88,0:10:00.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the vehicle first of all is roughly the same width as the Falcon 9
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.88,0:10:00.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 首先 火箭和猎鹰9号的宽度大致相同
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.64,0:10:03.66,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it has to be able to be moved down the street
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.64,0:10:03.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为它必须能够在公路上运输
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.68,0:10:04.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so it's a real road.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.68,0:10:04.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么就得能上路
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.95,0:10:06.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it's like 12 feet in diameter.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.95,0:10:06.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以它的直径好像是3.7米(12英尺)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.06,0:10:09.12,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's the diameter of the capsule.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.06,0:10:09.12,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这(也)是载人舱的直径(解释了宽度的限制)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.27,0:10:11.78,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now unlike most rockets that are aiming for orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.27,0:10:11.78,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 不像大多数火箭那样以轨道为目标
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.86,0:10:14.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}this is only aiming for 100 kilometers up
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.86,0:10:14.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}新谢泼德只需瞄准100公里的高度
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.00,0:10:18.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that kind of constrains the height and the width based upon the amount of fuel
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.00,0:10:18.16,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这就限制了推进剂的质量 从而限制了火箭的尺寸(高度和宽度)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.21,0:10:21.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that's why it's kind of this short stubby rocket.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.21,0:10:21.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs85}那么这就是为什么它是一种短粗的火箭(但这里主要解释了长度的限制)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.81,0:10:25.65,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But a big part of this look is down to the shape of that capsule on top
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.81,0:10:25.65,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是这个外观的很大一部分是归结于顶部的载人舱的形状
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.71,0:10:29.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that capsule was constrained by many requirements.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.71,0:10:29.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而那个载人舱受到许多要求的限制
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.08,0:10:31.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}First of all it had to be 12 feet in diameter to fit on roads.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.08,0:10:31.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}首先 它的直径(最大)必须是3.7米 以适应道路

Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.07,0:11:03.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but I think most of all
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.07,0:11:03.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我认为最重要的是
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.27,0:11:07.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it's the fact that the rocket gets thicker right at the very top

Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.83,0:11:44.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Normally during ascent the capsule sits on top of that
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.83,0:11:44.74,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}通常情况下 在上升过程中 载人舱是坐在上面的
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.79,0:11:48.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so no air flow through flows through the interior of that
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.79,0:11:48.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以没有空气流通过环形翼面的内部
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.22,0:11:50.24,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but as soon as as the capsule leaves

Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.39,0:11:52.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而火箭反向向下运动时 空气就会流过它
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.91,0:11:56.24,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that tends to keep it passively stable in the reverse
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.91,0:11:56.24,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这往往会使它在反向飞行中保持被动稳定

Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.91,0:08:12.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So basically they added a 386 processor with a 387 co-processor to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.91,0:08:12.57,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以基本上他们添加了一个386处理器和一个387协处理器
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.22,0:08:17.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the telescope operated with this weird hybrid system for six years

Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.80,0:08:51.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But over multiple service missions they started to replace those with solid-state drives
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.80,0:08:51.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在多次的维护任务中 他们开始用固态硬盘换掉这些磁带
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.20,0:08:56.69,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and on Mission 3A they gave it a 12 gigabyte storage system.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.20,0:08:56.69,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在3A任务中 他们给它配备了一个12GB的外存系统
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.10,0:09:00.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's also worth pointing out that while Hubble has two main computers,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.10,0:09:00.48,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}还值得指出的是 虽然哈勃有两台主计算机

Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.68,0:09:06.86,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Many of which have been replaced over the lifetime of the telescope.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.68,0:09:06.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在望远镜的生命周期中 其中许多已经被替换
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.12,0:09:10.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So these will have their own computer power
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.12,0:09:10.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 这些仪器将有自己的计算能力
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.53,0:09:17.51,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and since some of them are much younger than well the 1970s based computer that runs the the payload
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.53,0:09:17.51,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\fs82}而且由于其中一些计算机比运行有效载荷的1970年代的计算机要年轻得多
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.70,0:09:24.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it's quite likely that there are more powerful processors in some of the instruments than the NSSC

Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.60,0:09:26.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is currently causing us problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.60,0:09:26.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而此时 NSSC正在导致问题
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.95,0:09:33.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Finally I'm sure some of you are wondering is it possible to send up a mission to replace this or fix it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.95,0:09:33.30,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最后 我相信有人想知道 是否有可能派出一个任务来替换它或修复它
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.28,0:09:39.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Servicing the Hubble Space Telescope was something that really used the capabilities of the Space Shuttle.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.28,0:09:39.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}为哈勃太空望远镜进行维护是真正利用航天飞机的能力的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.92,0:09:44.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And there's nothing flying right now that has all those capabilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.92,0:09:44.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而现在没有任何现役航天器具备所有这些能力
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.64,0:09:46.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Dragon could certainly rendezvous with it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.64,0:09:46.74,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}龙飞船当然可以与它交会
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.77,0:09:52.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it doesn't have a manipulator system and doesn't have any ability to perform an EVA.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.77,0:09:52.02,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它没有机械臂系统 也不能执行EVA
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.06,0:09:53.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Same with Starliner.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.06,0:09:53.37,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}星际客机也是如此
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.08,0:09:56.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Nothing Russia has that can do this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.08,0:09:56.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}俄罗斯没有任何东西可以做到这一点
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.80,0:09:59.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Starship. Sure that's going to be big
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.80,0:09:59.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}星船 当然这将是很大的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.54,0:10:06.65,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it's not currently had any scoping for robotic manipulator systems or EVAs or anything like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.54,0:10:06.65,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它目前没有任何无人机械臂或EVA或类似的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.69,0:10:13.09,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that's very likely a decade of development away if that system proves to work.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.69,0:10:13.09,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 等到星船的类似系统得到验证的时候 可能需要10年的开发
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.60,0:10:19.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs40}We have recently seen the refurbishment of a couple of geostationary satellites using Mission Extension Vehicles

Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.00,0:10:24.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but these are primarily there to provide attitude control and propulsion.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.00,0:10:24.02,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这些任务主要是提供姿态控制和推进的
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.06,0:10:30.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They basically fly up behind it and attached to the satellite through one of the thrusters.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.06,0:10:30.08,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}基本上是飞到卫星后面 通过(目标卫星的其中一个)推进器连接上去
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.35,0:10:33.20,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then there the mission is able to continue.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.35,0:10:33.20,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后让任务得以继续进行
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.37,0:10:38.39,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But in this case the computer that's failing is something that manages all the payloads.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.37,0:10:38.39,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在这种情况下 发生故障的计算机是管理所有有效载荷的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.39,0:10:41.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's not just a case of providing attitude control.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.39,0:10:41.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这不仅仅是一个提供姿态控制的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.91,0:10:49.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it's not clear that an autonomous spacecraft could actually repair the Hubble Space Telescope right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.91,0:10:49.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 现在还不清楚一个无人航天器是否能真正修复哈勃太空望远镜
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.76,0:10:53.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm pretty confident that they will recover some operations of Hubble.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.52,0:04:14.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}本来应该有四根主缆
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.01,0:04:19.49,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But the fourth one broke in november which ultimately led to this collapse.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.01,0:04:19.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是第四根在11月断裂了 最终导致了这次的坍塌事件
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.56,0:04:23.61,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But if you look on the saddle there are a bunch of wire sticking out of the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.56,0:04:23.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但如果你看一下这个电缆鞍座 上面有一串钢丝伸出来
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.70,0:04:26.99,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}These are the remains of that fourth cable that broke.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.70,0:04:26.99,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些就是第四根断裂的线缆的残骸
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.55,0:04:30.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And if you're wondering what that black strap is. That's connecting two cables.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.55,0:04:30.96,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那条黑色的带子是用来连接两条线缆的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.99,0:04:36.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's part of a pully system(?) which was used to lower the socket from the first cable that failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.99,0:04:36.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那是拉力系统的一部分 用来降低第一根线缆断裂处的插座(位置)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.88,0:04:40.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It just slipped out of its socket rather than snapping.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.88,0:04:40.11,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它只是从插座上滑落下来 而不是断掉了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.05,0:04:46.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the other two support cables were attached to a structure that was added in the 1990s.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.05,0:04:46.18,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么另外两根支撑线缆被连接到90年代添加的结构上
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.19,0:04:50.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so this is a frame from later in the video and one of them is missing because that's the one that fell out.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.19,0:04:50.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这是视频后部分的一帧画面 其中一根支撑线缆没了 因为那根脱落了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.80,0:04:56.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But the one nearest us you can see hanging down there that's after the tension has been dropped on.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.80,0:04:56.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但离我们最近的那条你可以看到还挂在那里 这是拍摄在拉力释放掉之后的时间
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.39,0:04:58.19,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that's where those cables are attached.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.39,0:04:58.19,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这就是那些线缆连接的地方
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.63,0:05:00.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Watch for them when things start moving.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.63,0:05:00.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当事情开始发生的时候要看着他们
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.50,0:05:04.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Okay so now the video is playing at one quarter speed
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.50,0:05:04.56,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好了 现在视频正在以四分之一的速度播放
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.56,0:05:09.79,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the cable to watch is the one in the middle the one the lower one with the black strap around it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.56,0:05:09.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}要注意的是中间 靠下的那根有黑色带子的线
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.84,0:05:17.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now you'll see it's lost a lot of paint that is because the wires have been snapping inside the cable.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.84,0:05:17.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么你会发现它掉了很多油漆 那是因为线缆内的钢丝断裂了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.54,0:05:20.90,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And every time they do that they just knock the paint off the exterior.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.54,0:05:20.90,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}每次有钢丝断裂时 都会打掉了外部的油漆
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.13,0:05:23.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So there's going to be a single break.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.13,0:05:23.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么接下来就会有一根线缆断裂
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.58,0:05:29.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And when a single wire breaks the other ones shift a little to take up the load.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.58,0:05:29.10,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当一根线缆断裂时 其他线缆就会移动一下 以承担起负载
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.60,0:05:34.39,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And so there's a bit of dynamic force going on as the load moves around.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.60,0:05:34.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么当负载移动时 就会有一点动态力的作用
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.80,0:05:39.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But eventually the cable appears to just pull out of its socket.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.80,0:05:39.58,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但最终线缆似乎只是被拉出其插座
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.11,0:05:44.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I mean you can see in this frame there's like one or two wires that are still there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.11,0:05:44.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我是指 在这帧画面中 还保持着一两个线缆 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.08,0:05:47.32,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but everything else is moving to the left under the tension.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.08,0:05:47.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但其他所有的东西都在拉力的作用下向左移动
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.75,0:05:50.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So what happens at the end of these cables is
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.75,0:05:50.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这些线缆的末端是这么固定的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.34,0:05:54.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they take all the wires and they spread them out into a wide bundle
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.34,0:05:54.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们把所有钢丝散开捆成一束
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.86,0:05:57.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and put that inside like a cup shaped socket.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.86,0:05:57.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后把它放在杯状的插座里面
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.87,0:06:00.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Then they pour zinc inside that
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.87,0:06:00.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后他们把锌倒进去
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.08,0:06:05.73,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the zinc of course sets and that way you have essentially a solid metal blob at the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.08,0:06:05.73,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而锌就会嵌进去 这样一来 线缆的末端就形成了一个实心的金属球
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.09,0:06:11.01,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And of course that's what's on the other side of the saddle being held in by this structure.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.09,0:06:11.01,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 在鞍座的另一侧 线缆也是被这个结构固定住的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.52,0:06:13.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So now that load is being released.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.52,0:06:13.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么现在这个负载被释放了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.28,0:06:18.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You've got even more dynamic redistribution of load between the other cables
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.28,0:06:18.05,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其他线缆就得到了更多的动态负载
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.08,0:06:22.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they're now handling a static load would be twice what they're supposed to handle.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.08,0:06:22.96,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这些线缆现在所承受的静态负载会是设计上的两倍
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.61,0:06:26.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Of course dynamic loads are going to be even higher
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.61,0:06:26.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 动态负载会更高
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.00,0:06:31.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and if you look the cable behind it is already starting to come apart and it is going to snap.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.00,0:06:31.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且如果你看后面的线缆就会发现 它已经开始散开了 要断了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.51,0:06:36.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But watch the cable nearest us that it's nice and clean and white
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.51,0:06:36.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是你看离我们最近的那根线缆 它又白又净又好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.06,0:06:39.32,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but as it becomes the main load-bearing object
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.06,0:06:39.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但由于它成为了主要的承重对象
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.19,0:06:45.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}just watch all those wires snapping inside of this very very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.19,0:06:45.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在就能看到这里面的线缆在非常快速地断裂
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.01,0:06:51.59,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It had been doing such a good job up until this moment but it was more than it was designed for
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.01,0:06:51.59,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在这之前 这跟线缆工作得很正常 但现在这样的负载已经超出了它的设计
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.59,0:06:57.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and now it parts ways and at this point all the main cables have snapped
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.59,0:06:57.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在它分离了 这时所有的主线缆都断了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.68,0:07:02.24,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the platform is beginning to fall down under the force of gravity.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.68,0:07:02.24,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而平台在重力的作用下开始往下掉
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.64,0:07:06.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can also notice by the way the previously broken cable.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.64,0:07:06.68,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}顺便 你也可以发现 之前断裂的线缆(导致)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.09,0:07:09.59,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The socket has now been pushed out the other side
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.09,0:07:09.59,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在插座已经被推到了另一边去了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.59,0:07:14.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that those cables are sticking up over the top are now falling away down the back.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.59,0:07:14.70,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而那些从顶部伸出来的线缆现正从后面掉落
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.16,0:07:16.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So as the drone backs away,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.16,0:07:16.56,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么随着无人机的后退
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.59,0:07:20.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the auxiliary cable at the bottom of the frame you can see it wobbling and falling down.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.59,0:07:20.96,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}框架底部的辅助线缆 你可以看到正它摇摇晃晃地往下掉
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.50,0:07:26.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The cable at the top is still trying to support the wave guide and the catwalk
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.50,0:07:26.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}顶部的线缆还在努力支撑着波段和天桥
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.42,0:07:30.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but that is gonna end up getting hit.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.42,0:07:30.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这跟线缆最终也要完蛋
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.16,0:07:33.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and so it snaps and you'll see a wave go into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.16,0:07:33.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么它就断裂了 你会看到这跟线缆发生了波动
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.28,0:07:38.49,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now looks like it snaps from both ends because of a shock hitting that cable.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.28,0:07:38.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在看来 它同时从两端折断 因为冲击力穿过了线缆
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.77,0:07:42.76,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that force is basically coming from the destruction of the catwalk.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.77,0:07:42.76,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这股力量基本上来自于天桥的毁坏
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.79,0:07:46.49,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see it at the top sort of in the curving across.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.79,0:07:46.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到它在顶部的弯曲交叉处
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.03,0:07:53.25,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The cables from the platform are smashing through that and pulling the cable free.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.03,0:07:53.25,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}平台上的线缆正在砸穿它 同时彻底脱落
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.48,0:07:57.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So all that cabling is now falling towards the dish
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.48,0:07:57.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么所有的线缆现在都落到了碟型天线里
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.52,0:08:02.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you'll see the scars that it makes in the dish as it hits the surface.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.52,0:08:02.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且在它落到表面的时候 你会看到它在天线里打出的伤痕
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.42,0:08:09.19,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But also watch carefully on the left side, you can see the top two segments of the tower.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.42,0:08:09.19,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但也要仔细观察左侧 你可以看到塔的顶部两段
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.19,0:08:17.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I believe that is like 150 feet, 45 meters worth of reinforced concrete falling down.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.19,0:08:17.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我觉得那差不多是150英尺 45米高的钢筋混凝土掉了下来
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.67,0:08:25.29,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And equally as it pans across you can see a smaller chunk of tower number 12 falling down.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.67,0:08:25.29,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而同样的 当它平移过来的时候 你可以看到12号塔的一小块也在往下掉
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.38,0:08:30.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So anyway I think that's all the important things to see from the drone footage.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.38,0:08:30.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么无论如何 我想这是从无人机视频中可以看到的所有重要的东西 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.98,0:08:34.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Let's switch over to the gopro footage from the control room.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.98,0:08:34.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}让我们切换到控制室的Gopro视频
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.31,0:08:37.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So again I'm going to run this at a quarter speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.31,0:08:37.55,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我还是要以四分之一的速度运行这段视频
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.91,0:08:41.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So looking at the triangular platform,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.91,0:08:41.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 看着三角平台
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.42,0:08:44.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you've got the curved azimuth arm hanging underneath it

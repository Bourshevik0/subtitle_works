Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.20,0:12:07.21,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这东西太酷了
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.74,0:12:11.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Yeah so that's the state of things.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.74,0:12:11.27,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是啊 所以这些就是一些事情的状态
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.30,0:12:15.98,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm sorry I don't have any fancy insights or anything for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.30,0:12:15.98,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}对不起 我没有任何花哨的见解
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.01,0:12:17.28,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was one cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.01,0:12:17.28,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有一件事很酷
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.91,0:12:23.87,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Somebody from JPL tweeted an image of their desktop showing the range control phase of the flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.91,0:12:23.87,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}某个JPL的人在推特上发了一张他们桌面的图片 显示了飞行的范围控制阶段
Dialogue: 0,0:12:24.26,0:12:32.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And I initially mistook the angle for the range control as the lander trying to traverse towards the surface
Dialogue: 0,0:12:24.26,0:12:32.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我一开始误以为范围控制的角度 也就是着陆器试图向火星表面移动的角度
Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.44,0:12:38.03,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but this is actually during the hypersonic descent on with the heat shield.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:32.44,0:12:38.03,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这实际上这是在高超音速下降过程中 在有隔热板的情况下
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.46,0:12:41.66,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The vehicle is forced to turn, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.46,0:12:41.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}航天器被迫的转动 对吧
Dialogue: 0,0:12:41.67,0:12:45.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It has an offset center of mass that causes the vehicle to turn one way or another.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:41.67,0:12:45.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它有一个偏移的质量中心 导致飞行器得转向一个方向或另一个方向
Dialogue: 0,0:12:45.73,0:12:51.51,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And so it does these roll reversals, weaving its way towards the target that it wants
Dialogue: 0,0:12:45.73,0:12:51.51,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以它做了这些滚转的动作 朝着它想要的目标蜿蜒前进
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.54,0:12:57.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and if it realizes the target is further away than it expects it can roll (upwards) so that it gets a bit of lift
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.54,0:12:57.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果它意识到目标比预期的要远 它就可以向上翻转 这样就能得到一定的升力
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.14,0:13:02.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and if it's going to be closer than it expects it can roll downwards to drive it down
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.14,0:13:02.46,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果目标比预期的更近 它可以向下翻转 以俯冲
Dialogue: 0,0:13:02.50,0:13:07.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and if it just is at the right distance it can weave left and right to try to put itself there.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:02.50,0:13:07.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果距离合适 可以左右迂回
Dialogue: 0,0:13:07.44,0:13:13.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that's what these 60 degree angles I was remarking on are talking about.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:07.44,0:13:13.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这就是我所说的60度角
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.54,0:13:19.60,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yeah I'm not sure what else there is to talk about but hopefully we'll see more on monday.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.54,0:13:19.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么是的 我不知道还有什么可以谈的 但希望我们在周一会看到更多的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.63,0:13:22.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Until then I'm Scott Manley. Fly safe.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.63,0:13:22.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在那之前 我是Scott Manley 切记 注意飞行安全
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.62,0:13:42.38,1080P-sgbd-4s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}[Music]
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.62,0:13:42.38,1080P-sgsm-6s,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}[音乐]

Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.67,0:00:05.20,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你好 我是Scott Manley
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.20,0:00:11.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Today SpaceX down in Boca Chica had another test flight of a Starship prototype.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.20,0:00:11.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,940)}今天SpaceX在Boca Chica又进行了一次Starship原型机的试飞
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.67,0:00:15.67,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Starship SN10 took to the skies on its second attempt.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.67,0:00:15.67,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Starship SN10进行了第二次试飞
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.76,0:00:23.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the first attempt counted all the way down and aborted at T-0.1 seconds
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.76,0:00:23.27,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第一次试飞在倒计时0.1秒时就中止了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.27,0:00:27.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but later in the day all the engines took to flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.27,0:00:27.43,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在当天晚些时候 所有的发动机都起飞了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.53,0:00:34.58,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now apparently the earlier abort was because one engine was producing too much power.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.53,0:00:34.58,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么显然之前的中止是因为一台发动机产生了过大的推力
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.00,0:00:41.37,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And so they had decided to just reset the automatic systems and allow it to do what it wanted.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.00,0:00:41.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们决定重设自动系统 让它做它想做的事
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.20,0:00:46.62,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I don't know if that's relevant but later on in the flight when they were down to two engines,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.20,0:00:46.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不知道这是否相关 但在后来的飞行过程中 在只剩下两台发动机运行的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.64,0:00:51.58,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it was very obvious that one engine was burning a slightly different color than another one.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.64,0:00:51.58,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很明显 一台发动机与另一台发动机燃烧的颜色略有不同
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.60,0:00:55.42,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}this would typically indicate that you're perhaps running fuel rich.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.60,0:00:55.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这通常表明发动机在富燃运行
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.44,0:01:01.45,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\fs40}Therefore you're more orange because there's more carbon in the exhaust that's able to emit black body radiation.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.44,0:01:01.45,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此火焰的颜色更偏橙色 因为废气里有更多的碳 能够发出黑体辐射
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.98,0:01:04.64,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Other than that everything went as it has before.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.98,0:01:04.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}除此之外 一切都和以前一样
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.64,0:01:11.19,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}right down to the vehicle getting as high as it would at a T+4:20 before turning off its engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.64,0:01:11.19,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}直到T+4:20 航天器在关闭发动机前 达到最高点
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.73,0:01:15.92,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}From here it transitions into the horizontal skydive orientation.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.73,0:01:15.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}从这里开始 它过渡到水平{\i1}跳伞式下落{\i0} 的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.07,0:01:21.20,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You get a great view of that square area of thermal protection tiles are being tested.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.07,0:01:21.20,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这下你可以好好地看到那个用来测试的排成方形区域的隔热瓦
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.20,0:01:23.90,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Obviously they're not needed at these velocities.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.20,0:01:23.90,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很明显 在这样的速度下不需要它们
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.90,0:01:26.06,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but they do want to make sure they stay attached
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.90,0:01:26.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但工作人员想确保隔热瓦能好好地固定上
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.08,0:01:29.74,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it would suck to lose them at orbital speeds.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.08,0:01:29.74,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为在轨道速度下 失去隔热瓦会很糟
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.30,0:01:35.23,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And again they demonstrated that the vehicle could maintain control in the horizontal orientation.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.30,0:01:35.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们再次验证了航天器可以在水平方向上保持控制
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.62,0:01:40.22,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But what they really wanted to do was demonstrate that it would be able to land.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.62,0:01:40.22,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但他们真正想做的是验证它的着陆能力
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.26,0:01:43.31,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The previous two have failed for various reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.26,0:01:43.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}前两次在各种原因的影响下都失败了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.52,0:01:47.49,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This time the plan was to light up three engines in quick succession.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.52,0:01:47.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这次的计划是连续点燃三台发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.84,0:01:51.33,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then shut them down relieving only one.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.84,0:01:51.33,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后关闭它们 只让一台发动机继续运行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.84,0:01:57.83,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you'll see that all three lit and then two shut down very quickly leaving one to perform the landing.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.84,0:01:57.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\fs60}所以你会看到 三台发动机都点燃了 然后两台很快就关闭了 只留下一台发动机进行着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.86,0:02:00.93,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now we'll talk about that fire later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.86,0:02:00.93,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我们后面再谈着火这个问题
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.52,0:02:10.23,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Great thing is it did actually slow down and put itself on the pad although not as gently as it would like.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.52,0:02:10.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好事是它确实放慢了速度 并成功着陆 虽然并不是那么轻柔的着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.23,0:02:14.15,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If you looked very carefully there you might have seen a bit of a bounce.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.23,0:02:14.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你仔细看 会发现有一点反弹
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.64,0:02:17.02,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But this was a massive success.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.64,0:02:17.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这是一个巨大的成功
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.04,0:02:20.25,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The first real demonstration of Starship's landing maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.04,0:02:20.25,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是Starship着陆动作的第一次真正验证
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.26,0:02:23.20,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There were a lot of doubts about whether this would be controllable.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.26,0:02:23.20,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当时有很多人怀疑这个过程是否可以控制
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.44,0:02:25.44,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Whether they could put it on target.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.44,0:02:25.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们是否能把它放在目标上
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.44,0:02:30.75,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and yeah we saw it on the third attempt albeit not perfect.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.44,0:02:30.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 我们在这第三次尝试时就看到了 尽管并不完美
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.82,0:02:32.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's a bit of fire going on there.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.82,0:02:32.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}底部有一点着火
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.39,0:02:34.16,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Something possibly got damaged.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.39,0:02:34.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有东西可能被损坏了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.19,0:02:38.80,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And I'm sure the people were starting to celebrate.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.19,0:02:38.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我敢肯定 人们已经开始庆祝了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.90,0:02:44.83,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And of course the SpaceX webcast finished before we got to see what happens next.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.90,0:02:44.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 SpaceX的网络直播在我们发现接下来的事情之前就结束了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.20,0:02:49.57,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But of course SpaceX weren't the only people pointing cameras at this.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.35,0:03:42.64,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Do we have any clues as to what might have gone wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.35,0:03:42.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}我们能发现它出问题的任何线索吗
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.86,0:03:44.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So let's look at some other footage.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.86,0:03:44.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那么让我们看看其他视频吧
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.42,0:03:49.10,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is LabPadre's live stream and they have a really stable camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.42,0:03:49.10,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}这是LabPadre的直播 他们的相机非常稳定
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.00,0:03:52.22,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Again you see the vehicle coming down.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.00,0:03:52.22,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}同样的 你可以看到航天器再次着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.26,0:03:54.66,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see the landing legs deploying there.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.26,0:03:54.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}你可以看到着陆腿在那里展开
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.95,0:03:56.08,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Little bit of activity.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.95,0:03:56.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那有一点儿动静
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.08,0:04:02.22,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}A lot of fire coming out of the side there and a bounce you can really see the bounce here.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.08,0:04:02.22,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}很多火焰从侧面射出 还有一点弹跳
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.70,0:04:07.84,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's also a 4K stream so we can get a close look at those legs deploying
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.70,0:04:07.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这也是一个4K的直播 所以我们可以近距离看到这些着陆腿的部署过程
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.84,0:04:09.67,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}or are not actually deploying.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.84,0:04:09.67,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}或者实际上没有部署成功
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.16,0:04:14.10,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it looked like three of the legs deployed and locked in place.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.16,0:04:14.10,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么看起来有三条腿已经展开并锁住了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.77,0:04:17.30,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Well three of them just kind of swung back and forth
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.77,0:04:17.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好吧 另外三个只是在来回摆动
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.32,0:04:21.78,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and well we're not in a position to do the job for which they were intended.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.32,0:04:21.78,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且没法完成它们的工作
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.41,0:04:25.28,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now these legs are a temporary solution.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.41,0:04:25.28,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 这些腿只是一个临时解决方案
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.28,0:04:29.90,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They are designed to get crushed by the force of the impact absorbing the energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.28,0:04:29.90,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一种类似粉碎芯的结构 可以被冲击的力量压碎 并吸收能量
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.40,0:04:35.84,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And of course having only three of them instead of six means there's a lot less crush to go around.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.40,0:04:35.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 只有三条腿而不是六条腿意味着压碎的部分少了很多
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.84,0:04:40.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that probably contributed to having a lot more force applied to the body.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.84,0:04:40.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这可能也导致更多的力量施加到了箭体上
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.89,0:04:44.72,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}When the smoke cleared this was very much the leaning tower of Starship.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.89,0:04:44.72,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当烟雾散去后 这就很像是Starship斜塔
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.72,0:04:49.11,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It had collapsed onto the rear without any of the legs being visible.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.72,0:04:49.11,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Starship一屁股坐在地上 看不到任何的腿
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.14,0:04:52.09,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was no space between the skirt and the ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.14,0:04:52.09,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}裙板和地面之间没有任何空间
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.49,0:04:57.70,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Using the same video stream I also plotted like little vertical slices and put them side by side.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.49,0:04:57.70,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}使用相同的视频流 我还把每一帧图像做成垂直切片并拼接起来
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.43,0:05:02.11,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Basically the idea is to try and figure out the velocity that this thing was going.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.43,0:05:02.11,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}基本上 我是想试图搞清楚航天器的速度
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.54,0:05:07.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And one of the things that was very obvious was that it wasn't really decelerating at this point.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.54,0:05:07.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其中一件事是非常明显的 就是它这时并没有真正减速
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.29,0:05:13.14,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It was moving downwards at a constant 15 miles per hour or thereabouts.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.29,0:05:13.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它以6.7m/s左右的速度 匀速向下运动
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.70,0:05:15.19,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that seems excessive.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.70,0:05:15.19,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这似乎有点过高了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.23,0:05:19.92,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But I think I'm more interested in the fact that it didn't seem to be slowing down at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.23,0:05:19.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我更感兴趣的是它在这段运动中似乎根本没有减速的事实
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.52,0:05:25.35,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}During the landing process if you remember they wanted to light all three engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.52,0:05:25.35,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在着陆过程中 如果你还记得他们想把三台发动机都点燃
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.36,0:05:31.02,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because it previously had problem with a single engine not lighting when they tried to fly with two.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.36,0:05:31.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是因为之前他们尝试用两台发动机飞行时 出现了一台发动机无法点火的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.49,0:05:37.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the plan was to relight three and then pick the best two and then shut them down progressively.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.49,0:05:37.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而计划是将三台发动机重新点燃 然后挑选出最好的两台发动机 然后逐步关闭它们
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.60,0:05:41.32,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And finally leave a single engine to do the landing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.60,0:05:41.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最后留下一个发动机进行着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.86,0:05:44.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this is the official SpaceX footage
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.86,0:05:44.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这是以四分之一的速度播放的SpaceX官方的视频
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.72,0:05:48.37,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}basically showing the flip and burn maneuver playing at one quarter speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.72,0:05:48.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}基本上是展示了翻转和点火的机动
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.62,0:05:50.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It looks unearthly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.62,0:05:50.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它看起来不可思议
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.38,0:05:51.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It looks unreal.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.38,0:05:51.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它看起来不真实
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.77,0:05:54.66,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yeah you can see all three engines firing there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.77,0:05:54.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是 是的 你可以看到所有的三台发动机在那里点火
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.83,0:06:01.02,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And now one gets shut down and the second one shuts down almost instantly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.83,0:06:01.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而现在一台关闭 而第二台几乎也是立刻关闭
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.74,0:06:03.31,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was some question about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.74,0:06:03.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}关于这件事 有一些问题
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.81,0:06:08.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Furthermore the second shutdown seems to blow out a lot of methane.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.81,0:06:08.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第二台发动机关闭时 似乎吹出了大量的甲烷
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.53,0:06:10.90,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we get a fair amount of combustion going on
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.53,0:06:10.90,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且有相当一部分甲烷在继续燃烧
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.38,0:06:17.15,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}as it's transitioning into the final hover and controlled landing with that single engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.38,0:06:17.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}此时航天器正使用单台发动机过渡到最后的悬停和可控的着陆时
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.62,0:06:22.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That single engine should have enough thrust to be able to stop this thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.62,0:06:22.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}单台发动机应该有足够的推力来让航天器停下来
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.10,0:06:28.54,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}From this angle you also see that it had to do a fairly large translation back towards the pad.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.10,0:06:28.54,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}从这个角度你还可以看到它必须做一个相当大的平移来回到着陆场
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.56,0:06:31.20,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It had overshot by lighting three engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.56,0:06:31.20,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}点燃三台发动机进行翻转的过程 导致了这个平移
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.75,0:06:34.46,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And yeah that's that engine that shut down.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.75,0:06:34.46,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 就是那台关闭了的发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.49,0:06:39.51,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It seems there's a lot more methane venting during this final part of the process.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.49,0:06:39.51,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}看来在这最后的过程中 还有很多甲烷在排放
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.11,0:06:42.40,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I think there may be a stuck valve at this point
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.11,0:06:42.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想这时可能有一个阀门卡住了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.40,0:06:45.33,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because of course after the heavy landing
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.40,0:06:45.33,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然是因为在较重的着陆之后
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.18,0:06:48.20,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}there was enough stuff burning on the ground
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.18,0:06:48.20,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}地上有很多东西在燃烧
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.22,0:06:52.32,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that they needed to employ the water deluge system to help control the situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.22,0:06:52.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}于是他们需要使用喷水系统来帮忙控制局面
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.72,0:06:56.96,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that fire was coming from one of the ground service pipes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.72,0:06:56.96,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 那窜火是从一个地面服务管道里出来的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.36,0:07:00.52,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I think this is how they would normally load methane into the rocket.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.36,0:07:00.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想这就是正常情况下甲烷加注的管道
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.81,0:07:07.99,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see that it's shooting down initially and generating that cryogenic white cloud of very cold gas.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.81,0:07:07.99,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到它一开始是向下排出气体 并产生低温白色气体
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.30,0:07:12.42,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And over time that the flame burns down into it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.30,0:07:12.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而过了一会之后 火焰向下燃烧
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.45,0:07:14.28,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it's not coming from one of the engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.45,0:07:14.28,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这并不是来自其中一台发动机(的火焰)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.30,0:07:15.66,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's the important thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.30,0:07:15.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这很重要
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.70,0:07:17.55,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is not an engine problem in this case.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.70,0:07:17.55,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在这种情况下 这不是发动机的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.90,0:07:24.13,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is definitely a plumbing problem, a problem with the vehicle fuel system.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.90,0:07:24.13,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这绝对是一个管道的问题  一个与航天器燃料系统相关的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.00,0:07:29.46,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And again you see that bounce which cannot be healthy for something that size.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.00,0:07:29.46,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同时 一样地 可以看到那种反弹 这对于这么大的航天器来说是不好的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.25,0:07:33.84,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}LabPadre also has some of the best footage of the development of the explosion.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.25,0:07:33.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}LabPadre也有爆炸发生时画面最好的视频
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.89,0:07:36.72,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So watch at the bottom fins right.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.89,0:07:36.72,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那么请看底部的翼面
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.56,0:07:43.98,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}First of all you'll see a puff of smoke coming out of the vents that are related to the engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.56,0:07:43.98,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}首先 你会看到一股烟从发动机的排气口喷出
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.58,0:07:52.21,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}See that black puff and then the oxygen tank essentially splits into and the vehicle goes upwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.58,0:07:52.21,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}看到那团黑烟了吗 然后液氧储罐基本上就裂开了 航天器就往上飞
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.25,0:07:56.73,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}What's happening is that tank splits all the gas pressures pushing the vehicle up.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.25,0:07:56.73,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}这里发生的事情是 液氧储罐裂开时产生的所有气体压力 推动航天器上升
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.30,0:08:01.58,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But once that has gone up there's more pressure in the tank above it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.30,0:08:01.58,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}但一旦航天器上升 其上的储罐里就会有更大的压力
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.60,0:08:05.97,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that actually pushes out the bulkhead although we can't see it on this footage.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.60,0:08:05.97,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}而这实际上是把隔板推出去了 虽然我们在这段录像中看不到它的存在
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.67,0:08:11.06,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I want you to appreciate there's enough pressure in those tanks that when the tank fails.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.67,0:08:11.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}我想让你知道的是 在储罐出现故障的时候 其中有着足够的压力
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.36,0:08:15.83,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That is entirely responsible for pushing the vehicle upwards and causing its destruction.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.36,0:08:15.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}储罐中的压力是让航天器上升 并使之摧毁的原因
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.24,0:08:19.03,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The fire is sort of an incidental effect in this case.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.24,0:08:19.03,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}在这种情况下 火是一种附带的效果
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.05,0:08:22.56,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It may make the launch a little more aggressive
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.05,0:08:22.56,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}它可能会使{\i1}这种发射{\i0} 更有侵略性
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.66,0:08:29.17,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but a tank failure like that would send the vehicle upwards and be quite spectacular on its own.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.66,0:08:29.17,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}但这样的储罐故障 会让航天器往上飞 本身就很壮观
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.78,0:08:35.80,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's actually similar to some earlier Starship test article failures where it was just a pressure test failure.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.78,0:08:35.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}这其实类似于早期的一些Starship压力测试的失败
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.54,0:08:40.75,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this is like the last frame before we see the things starting to move.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.54,0:08:40.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那么这差不多是一切开始运动前的最后一帧
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.22,0:08:43.16,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Look at the nose cone.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.22,0:08:43.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}看看鼻锥
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.18,0:08:45.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Look how that is crumpling in.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.18,0:08:45.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}看它是如何扭曲的
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.04,0:08:49.93,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Remember there's a big mass of liquid oxygen in that nose in the very tip.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.04,0:08:49.93,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}要知道 在航天器的最顶端有一大团液氧
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.33,0:08:53.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the rest of the vehicle is getting pushed up against this
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.33,0:08:53.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}而航天器的其他部分被推到了这个位置上
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.23,0:08:57.77,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is causing everything to crinkle as it leaves the ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.23,0:08:57.77,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}导致所有的东西在离开地面的时候都皱了起来
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.06,0:09:02.07,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now NASASpaceflight they have a different angle it's sort of at 90 degrees.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.06,0:09:02.07,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那么NASASpaceflight他们有一个不同的角度 差不多和之前的角度差了90度
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.17,0:09:04.24,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Watch on the left side at the bottom.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.17,0:09:04.24,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}看看左边的底部
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.24,0:09:06.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You see how this is an asymmetric blast.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.24,0:09:06.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}你会发现这是一个不对称的爆炸
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.41,0:09:12.39,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And because it starts on one side that causes the whole upper part to flip over.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.41,0:09:12.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}因为它是从一边开始的 所以整个上部都会翻转过来
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.62,0:09:17.44,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it actually does the whole belly flop maneuver albeit a slightly lower altitude.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.62,0:09:17.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}所以它实际上做了整个机腹俯冲向下的机动 尽管高度稍低
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.60,0:09:21.51,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}In this one you can see the landing and the whole thing just flattens out instantly.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.60,0:09:21.51,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}在这段视频里 你可以看到在着陆的时候 整个航天器都瞬间变平了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.72,0:09:28.30,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That shows me that by the time it landed the bulkhead between the fuel tank and the oxygen tank had failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.72,0:09:28.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}这说明在它着陆的时候 燃料储罐和液氧储罐之间的隔板已经失效了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.32,0:09:32.92,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Otherwise there would be some sort of gas pressure in there and the thing would have gone sideways.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.32,0:09:32.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}否则里面会有某种程度的气体压力 因此航天器则会侧翻
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.51,0:09:36.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The good news for SpaceX engineers as you can see from this angle
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.51,0:09:36.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}对于SpaceX工程师来说 好消息是 从这个角度可以看到
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.53,0:09:40.32,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that the tiles are still attached even after that heavy landing.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.53,0:09:40.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}即使在重重的着陆之后 隔热瓦仍旧连接在航天器的外壁上
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.43,0:09:46.30,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Again look at the bottom of the rocket watch for the puffs of smoke and then we get this pressure failure.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.43,0:09:46.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}再看一下火箭的底部 注意看烟雾喷出的情况 然后我们就会看到这个失压的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.33,0:09:47.84,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see the tank coming apart.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.33,0:09:47.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}你可以看到储罐正在解体
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.88,0:09:50.15,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There you can't see any visible combustion.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.88,0:09:50.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}你看不到有任何可见的燃烧
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.17,0:09:52.37,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So I think it's the pressure that's driving this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.17,0:09:52.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}所以我认为是压力导致了这种情况
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.66,0:09:56.32,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Of course we're mixing liquid oxygen and methane
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.66,0:09:56.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}当然 液氧和甲烷正在混合
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.32,0:10:00.80,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so the next frame we see a very involved combustion process.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.32,0:10:00.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那么在下一帧里我们看到了一个非常复杂的燃烧过程
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.03,0:10:03.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But my point is I think this is pressure based
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.03,0:10:03.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}但我的观点是 这是基于压力的(爆炸)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.52,0:10:06.30,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}although the fire might have weakened something.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.52,0:10:06.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}虽然(之前的)火灾可能已经削弱了一些东西
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.55,0:10:09.16,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It might have caused some other leak or some damage.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.55,0:10:09.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}可能造成了一些其他的泄漏或者是损坏
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.50,0:10:13.53,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then of course the whole thing continues into a giant conflagration
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.50,0:10:13.53,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}然后 当然 整个事情继续 变成了一团巨大的火焰
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.76,0:10:17.19,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}becomes fodder for clickbaity videos on youtube.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.76,0:10:17.19,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}成为油管上标题党视频的素材
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.61,0:10:20.31,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We can put these side by side if you just want to compare.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.61,0:10:20.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}如果你只是想比较一下 我们可以把这些并排放在一起
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.34,0:10:23.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's hard to synchronize because the cameras have different frame rates.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.34,0:10:23.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}这两个视频很难同步 因为相机的帧率不同
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.62,0:10:28.87,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But again yeah it is not a pretty sight a lot of debris flying everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.62,0:10:28.87,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}但一样的是 这不是一个漂亮的景象 很多碎片到处飞
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.09,0:10:31.69,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So to summarize I don't have a smoking gun
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.09,0:10:31.69,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}那么总结一下 我没有确凿的证据
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.75,0:10:35.57,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but what we do have is the understanding that the landing was faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.75,0:10:35.57,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}但我们知道的是着陆速度较快
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.84,0:10:38.00,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The legs were not properly deployed.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.84,0:10:38.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}着陆腿的展开有问题
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.04,0:10:43.46,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It probably damaged something which ultimately led to a pressure failure in the oxygen tank.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.04,0:10:43.46,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\pos(960,950)}损坏了什么东西 最终导致液氧储罐失压
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.70,0:10:48.14,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Very quickly followed by the failure of the bulkhead between the two tanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.70,0:10:48.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很快 两个储罐之间的隔板也发生了故障
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.62,0:10:51.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that of course drove the second flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.62,0:10:51.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这当然也推动了第二次飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.36,0:10:58.00,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I wanted to joke that this is an example of SpaceX's RUSH development, Rapid Unplanned Second Hop.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.36,0:10:58.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想开玩笑说 这是SpaceX的RUSH开发的一个例子 即{\i1}意外的第二次迅速跳跃{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.62,0:11:03.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But the loss of the vehicle minutes after the landing shouldn't overshadow the fact that
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.62,0:11:03.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但着陆几分钟后航天器的损失 不应该掩盖这样的事实
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.04,0:11:10.24,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SpaceX have successfully demonstrated the transition from the belly flop into the landing orientation.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.04,0:11:10.24,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也就是SpaceX已经成功验证了从腹部向下到着陆方向的过渡
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.39,0:11:13.40,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This carefully put the vehicle on the pad.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.39,0:11:13.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而航天器的着陆力度问题
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.87,0:11:17.52,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They obviously need to do a little bit of work in making this more reliable.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.87,0:11:17.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}则显然需要他们再多做一点工作 使之更可靠
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.56,0:11:23.12,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But this is a huge win showing that SpaceX are capable of doing what they said they would do.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.56,0:11:23.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这是一个巨大的胜利 表明SpaceX有能力做到他们所说的事情

Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.50,0:00:49.45,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为天气不是很好
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.55,0:00:51.12,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but then when it did lift off
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.55,0:00:51.12,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但当它真的升空时
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.26,0:00:54.76,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,it seemed to execute successfully went through all the launch
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.26,0:00:54.76,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,它似乎成功地执行了所有的发射过程

Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.09,0:01:01.10,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,安全地完成了最大Q值的主发动机关闭和级间分离
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.12,0:01:04.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and then the second stage went out of control, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.12,0:01:04.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,然后第二级就失去了控制 对
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.13,0:01:05.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,It spun out of control.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.13,0:01:05.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,它失去了控制而旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.36,0:01:07.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So what what do we know.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.36,0:01:07.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么我们知道什么呢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.43,0:01:10.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Well we actually have a couple of foot cameras on board
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.43,0:01:10.55,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,好吧 我们实际上有几个脚下的摄像机在船上
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.58,0:01:14.63,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,that gave us pretty much all the information we needed along with the telemetry.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.58,0:01:14.63,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,给我们提供了几乎所有我们需要的信息 还有遥测数据
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.97,0:01:19.60,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So there was an external camera on the outside of the second stage that looks down
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.97,0:01:19.60,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以在第二级的外面有一个外部摄像机 可以向下看
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.60,0:01:22.21,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and that showed us most of the video of the launch.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.60,0:01:22.21,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,并向我们展示了发射的大部分视频
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.50,0:01:26.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Inside the interstage there was a camera that looks at the rocket nozzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.50,0:01:26.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,在中间级的内部有一个摄像头 看着火箭的喷口
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.05,0:01:28.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and we've seen that for most of the flights.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.05,0:01:28.57,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,我们已经看到了大部分的飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.28,0:01:33.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Now the one that looked at the nozzle froze during the stage separation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.28,0:01:33.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,现在 观察喷嘴的摄像机在级间分离时冻结了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.11,0:01:36.90,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but the external camera showed a clean stage separation.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.11,0:01:36.90,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但外部摄像机显示了一个干净的阶段分离
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.93,0:01:38.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,A little bit of wobble which is normal
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.93,0:01:38.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,有一点晃动 这是正常的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.64,0:01:43.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and then as soon as the second stage Rutherford engine fired up
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.64,0:01:43.02,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,然后当第二级卢瑟福发动机启动时
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.51,0:01:47.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,the view just swivels around out of shot and the thing is spinning.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.51,0:01:47.68,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,视线就在镜头外旋转 东西在旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.68,0:01:49.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,And that's the end of it, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.68,0:01:49.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,这就是它的结局 对
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.61,0:01:50.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,They can't recover from that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.61,0:01:50.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,他们无法从中恢复
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.38,0:01:52.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,If you look at the telemetry
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.38,0:01:52.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,如果你看一下遥测数据
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:58.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,you can actually see the velocity is sort of wobbling up and down every second or so
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:58.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,你实际上可以看到速度每秒钟都在上下晃动
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.00,0:02:01.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so the thing got put into a spin from which it couldn't recover
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.00,0:02:01.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以这东西进入了一个无法恢复的旋转状态
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.04,0:02:04.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and they probably just shut down the engine and let it fall into the ocean
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.04,0:02:04.14,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,他们可能只是关闭了引擎 让它掉进了海里
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.39,0:02:08.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,rather than let it continue firing its engine and potentially go out of its launch corridor.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.39,0:02:08.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而不是让它继续点燃它的引擎并有可能离开它的发射通道
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.03,0:02:12.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Now as for what caused that spin
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.03,0:02:12.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,至于是什么导致了旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.31,0:02:20.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,well if you look at the the camera that was inside the interstage that looked at the nozzle
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.31,0:02:20.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,好吧 如果你看一下在中间级里面的摄像头 它观察到了喷嘴
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.64,0:02:22.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,you can't really see very much.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.64,0:02:22.16,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,你真的看不出什么
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.16,0:02:25.19,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,What you can see is that the engine does light
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.16,0:02:25.19,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,你能看到的是 发动机确实点燃了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.36,0:02:28.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but it doesn't seem to run very long and it cools down very quickly
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.36,0:02:28.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但它似乎并没有运行很久 而且很快就冷却了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.80,0:02:35.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but if you actually compare it against the previous launch which was They Go Up So Fast
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.80,0:02:35.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但如果你把它与之前的发射进行比较 也就是它们飞得那么快
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.04,0:02:38.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and look at the exact position of that engine nozzle
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.04,0:02:38.56,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,并看一下那个发动机喷嘴的确切位置
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.56,0:02:43.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,you can see the nozzle is pushed over to the right in the one that launched last night.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.56,0:02:43.74,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,你可以看到在昨晚发射的那枚中 喷嘴被推到了右边
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.35,0:02:48.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Basically the second stage steers by gimbaling this nozzle, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.35,0:02:48.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,基本上第二级是通过万向节来控制这个喷嘴的方向 对
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:50.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So it can adjust the direction of the thrust
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:50.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以它可以调整推力的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.34,0:02:52.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and in this case it seems to have pushed it all the way over to the right
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.34,0:02:52.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,在这种情况下 它似乎把它全部推到了右边
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.95,0:02:56.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and some sort of technical problem it could be that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.95,0:02:56.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,还有一些技术问题 可能是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.80,0:03:00.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,they couldn't stop the actuator from moving.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.80,0:03:00.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,他们无法阻止推杆的移动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.23,0:03:04.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Maybe their sensor didn't detect that it moved all the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.23,0:03:04.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,也许他们的传感器没有检测到它一直在移动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.49,0:03:08.67,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,There's one suggestion sometimes that we've seen cases
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.49,0:03:08.67,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,有一个建议 有时我们已经看到了一些案例
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.70,0:03:15.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,where rockets have had the connections to adjust the position reversed
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.70,0:03:15.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,火箭的调整位置的连接被颠倒了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.67,0:03:18.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so that it was to steer to the right, steers to the left.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.67,0:03:18.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因此 它是向右转 向左转
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.15,0:03:19.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,That means it steers to the right more
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.15,0:03:19.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,这意味着它更多地向右转向
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.84,0:03:22.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and eventually loses control very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.84,0:03:22.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,并最终很快失去了控制
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.31,0:03:23.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,I don't think that happened in this case
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.31,0:03:23.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,我不认为这种情况发生在这个案例中
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.92,0:03:26.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because if you look at the external camera
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.92,0:03:26.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为如果你看一下外部摄像机
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.40,0:03:31.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,the initial wobble carries it in one direction and then it compensates
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.40,0:03:31.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,最初的晃动将它带向一个方向 然后它进行补偿
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.46,0:03:33.12,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and spins out of control in the other direction
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.46,0:03:33.12,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,然后在另一个方向上失去控制的旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.12,0:03:34.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so that's not what happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.12,0:03:34.48,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以这不是发生了什么

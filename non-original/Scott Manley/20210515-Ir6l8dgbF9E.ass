Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.12,0:01:04.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then the second stage went out of control, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.12,0:01:04.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后第二级就失去了控制 对
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.13,0:01:05.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It spun out of control.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.13,0:01:05.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它在旋转中失去了控制
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.36,0:01:07.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So what what do we know.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.36,0:01:07.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}关于此事我们知道什么呢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.43,0:01:10.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Well we actually have a couple of foot cameras on board
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.43,0:01:10.55,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好吧 实际上火箭里有几台底部摄像机
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.58,0:01:14.63,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that gave us pretty much all the information we needed along with the telemetry.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.58,0:01:14.63,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}几乎给了所有我们需要的信息 还有遥测数据
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.97,0:01:19.60,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So there was an external camera on the outside of the second stage that looks down
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.97,0:01:19.60,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第二级的外面有一台外部摄像机 可以向下看
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.60,0:01:22.21,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that showed us most of the video of the launch.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.60,0:01:22.21,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它向我们展示了发射时的大部分的影像
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.50,0:01:26.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Inside the interstage there was a camera that looks at the rocket nozzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.50,0:01:26.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在中间级的内部有一个摄像头 对准着火箭的喷口
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.05,0:01:28.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and we've seen that for most of the flights.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.05,0:01:28.57,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在大多数火箭发射中我们都能看到这个画面
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.28,0:01:33.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now the one that looked at the nozzle froze during the stage separation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.28,0:01:33.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当时观察喷嘴的摄像机在级间分离时冻住了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.11,0:01:36.90,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but the external camera showed a clean stage separation.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.11,0:01:36.90,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但外部摄像机显示这个分离十分成功
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.93,0:01:38.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}A little bit of wobble which is normal
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.93,0:01:38.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}虽然有一点晃动 但是这是正常的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.64,0:01:43.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then as soon as the second stage Rutherford engine fired up
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.64,0:01:43.02,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后当第二级卢瑟福发动机启动时
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.51,0:01:47.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the view just swivels around out of shot and the thing is spinning.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.51,0:01:47.68,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}镜头中的画面显示第二级开始旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.68,0:01:49.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that's the end of it, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.68,0:01:49.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这就是它最后的结局
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.61,0:01:50.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They can't recover from that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.61,0:01:50.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}工作人员无法将其从旋转中恢复
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.38,0:01:52.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If you look at the telemetry
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.38,0:01:52.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你观察遥测数据
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:58.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you can actually see the velocity is sort of wobbling up and down every second or so
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.88,0:01:58.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你实际上可以看到速度每秒钟都在上下变化
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.00,0:02:01.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so the thing got put into a spin from which it couldn't recover
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.00,0:02:01.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这东西进入了一个无法恢复的旋转状态
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.04,0:02:04.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they probably just shut down the engine and let it fall into the ocean
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.04,0:02:04.14,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}工作人员最后可能只是它的关闭了引擎 让它掉进了海里
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.39,0:02:08.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}rather than let it continue firing its engine and potentially go out of its launch corridor.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.39,0:02:08.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而不是让它的引擎继续工作并有可能离开它的发射走廊
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.03,0:02:12.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now as for what caused that spin
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.03,0:02:12.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}至于是什么导致了旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.31,0:02:20.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}well if you look at the the camera that was inside the interstage that looked at the nozzle
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.31,0:02:20.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4} 如果你看一下在中间级观察喷嘴的摄像头
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.64,0:02:22.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you can't really see very much.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.64,0:02:22.16,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你真的看不出什么
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.16,0:02:25.19,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}What you can see is that the engine does light
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.16,0:02:25.19,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你能看到的是 发动机确实成功点火了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.36,0:02:28.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it doesn't seem to run very long and it cools down very quickly
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.36,0:02:28.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它似乎并没有运行很久 而且很快就冷却了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.80,0:02:35.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but if you actually compare it against the previous launch which was They Go Up So Fast
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.80,0:02:35.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但如果你把它与之前的发射进行比较 也就是它上升更快时
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.04,0:02:38.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and look at the exact position of that engine nozzle
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.04,0:02:38.56,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}观察那个发动机喷嘴的确切位置
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.56,0:02:43.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you can see the nozzle is pushed over to the right in the one that launched last night.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.56,0:02:43.74,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到在昨晚发射的中 喷嘴被推到了右边
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.35,0:02:48.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Basically the second stage steers by gimbaling this nozzle, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.35,0:02:48.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第二级基本上是通过平衡环架来控制这个喷嘴的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:50.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it can adjust the direction of the thrust
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.64,0:02:50.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以它可以调整推力的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.34,0:02:52.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and in this case it seems to have pushed it all the way over to the right
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.34,0:02:52.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在这种情况下 它似乎把推力全部集中到了右边
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.95,0:02:56.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and some sort of technical problem it could be that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.95,0:02:56.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}还有一些技术问题 可能是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.80,0:03:00.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they couldn't stop the actuator from moving.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.80,0:03:00.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们无法阻止推杆的移动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.23,0:03:04.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Maybe their sensor didn't detect that it moved all the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.23,0:03:04.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也许他们的传感器没有检测到它一直在移动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.49,0:03:08.67,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's one suggestion sometimes that we've seen cases
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.49,0:03:08.67,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这有一个迹象 我们在过去的案例中看到过
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.67,0:03:15.61,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}where rockets have had the connections to adjust the position reversed
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.70,0:03:15.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那些案例中 火箭的调整姿态仪器的连接被颠倒了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.67,0:03:18.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that it was to steer to the right, steers to the left.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.67,0:03:18.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}正常讲 它会是均衡地向右转 向左转
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.15,0:03:19.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That means it steers to the right more
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.15,0:03:19.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}错误连接后它会更多地向右转向
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.84,0:03:22.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and eventually loses control very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.84,0:03:22.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最终火箭很快失去控制
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.31,0:03:23.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I don't think that happened in this case
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.31,0:03:23.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不认为这种情况发生在这个案例中
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.92,0:03:26.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because if you look at the external camera
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.92,0:03:26.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为如果你看一下外部摄像机
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.40,0:03:31.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the initial wobble carries it in one direction and then it compensates
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.40,0:03:31.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最初的晃动将它带向一个方向 然后它自己进行了补偿
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.46,0:03:33.12,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and spins out of control in the other direction
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.46,0:03:33.12,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后在另一个方向上旋转失去了控制

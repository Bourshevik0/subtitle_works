Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.23,0:03:47.86,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So if we assume that Venus formed from roughly the same material as earth
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.23,0:03:47.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因此 如果我们假设金星是由与地球大致相同的物质形成的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.14,0:03:52.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,then you would expect the ratios of hydrogen deuterium to be the same
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.14,0:03:52.08,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么你会期望氢氘的比例是相同的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.20,0:03:56.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but since Venus has 100 times more deuterium
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.20,0:03:56.48,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但是 由于金星的氘多出100倍
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.48,0:04:01.59,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,you have to imagine at some point it had 100 times more regular hydrogen
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.48,0:04:01.59,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,你必须想象在某些时候它有100倍的常规氢气
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.59,0:04:06.20,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and therefore at least 100 times more water in the past.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.59,0:04:06.20,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,并因此在过去至少有100倍的水
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.55,0:04:11.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,And that is of course a lower estimate assuming that no deuterium at all escapes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.55,0:04:11.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这当然是一个较低的估计 假设根本就没有氘逃逸
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.30,0:04:17.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,And the lack of water and Venus can also be responsible for its really thick atmosphere.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.30,0:04:17.44,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而水的缺乏和金星也可能是其真正的厚重大气的原因

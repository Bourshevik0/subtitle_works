Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.25,0:06:40.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it was quite common practice to have a backup satellite ready to go
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.25,0:06:40.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为准备一颗备用卫星是很常见的做法

Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.80,0:08:08.63,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because any gap means that you're losing efficiency
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.80,0:08:08.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为任何多余的缝隙都意味着你的效率在下降
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.63,0:08:11.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and of course touching the walls means you've got extra friction.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.63,0:08:11.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当然 (没有缝隙)接触内壁意味着你有额外的摩擦力
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.42,0:08:16.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But anything that can get stuck in that tiny gap can be a real drag

Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.94,0:08:21.79,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为其启动非常缓慢
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.84,0:08:28.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because they sort of rely on waste engine heat to boil hydrogen so they can drive those pumps.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.84,0:08:28.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这差不多是因为(膨胀循环)依靠发动机的废热来加热液氢到沸点 才能驱动这些泵

Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.16,0:09:49.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这里发生的事情是
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.70,0:09:54.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}was that the engine chill down system would run cold helium through some parts of the engine
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.70,0:09:54.27,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}发动机冷却系统在发动机的某些部分中通过冷氦气

Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.14,0:10:09.09,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it turns out that these one-way valves weren't quite as one-way as expected under the operating conditions.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.14,0:10:09.09,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但事实证明 这些单向阀在特定的工作条件下并不像预期的那样起作用
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.53,0:10:16.07,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So air would actually leak back in through these check valves and that air would liquefy at the temperature.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.58,0:10:54.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but since then Atlas had had a near perfect launch record.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.58,0:10:54.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但从那时起 宇宙神的发射记录近乎完美

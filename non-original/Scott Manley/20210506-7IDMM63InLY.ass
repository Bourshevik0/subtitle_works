Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.21,0:00:55.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Hello, it's Scott Manley here.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.21,0:00:55.26,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你好 我是Scott Manley
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.26,0:00:57.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}What a marvelous intro that was.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.26,0:00:57.48,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那是一个多么了不起的开场啊
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.51,0:00:59.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Yeah, I put that together as a joke,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.51,0:00:59.56,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 为了搞笑 我把它放在一起
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.58,0:01:05.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because there was a good chance that Starship Serial Number 15 was going to fly on May the fourth,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.58,0:01:05.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为编号为15的星船原本很有可能会在5月4日飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.49,0:01:07.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but you know what It still works,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.49,0:01:07.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但你猜怎么着 这个笑话仍然有效
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.98,0:01:11.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because we can call that revenge of the 5th.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.98,0:01:11.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为我们可以称其为5号的复仇
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.35,0:01:13.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Like, regardless, yes,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.35,0:01:13.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}就像……不管这些了 是的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.46,0:01:20.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SpaceX yesterday, they successfully flew a Starship for a High altitude test.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.46,0:01:20.10,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SpaceX昨天 成功地让一艘星船进行了高空试飞
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.10,0:01:21.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They performed their belly flop.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.10,0:01:21.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}进行了腹部向下机动
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.87,0:01:24.45,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They performed their transition to landing, and they landed,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.87,0:01:24.45,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}进行了着陆前的姿态转变 并且着陆了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.47,0:01:27.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they didn't explode 10 minutes later
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.47,0:01:27.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且10分钟后也没有爆炸
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.46,0:01:33.67,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}marking the first fully successful flight of a Starship prototype, showing the whole system.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.46,0:01:33.67,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这标志着星船原型机的首次完全成功飞行 验证了整个系统
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.22,0:01:38.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now this is a pretty big deal because we've seen four failures so far.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.22,0:01:38.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这是很重要的 因为到目前为止已经发生了四次失败
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.98,0:01:45.10,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because of the way SpaceX is very happy to throw hardware out there and test it by flying it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.98,0:01:45.10,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为SpaceX非常乐意把设备放在外边 并通过飞行来测试它
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.01,0:01:51.86,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But SN15 had a number of changes that were expected to solve problems that had previously been seen.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.01,0:01:51.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但SN15有一些变化 之前就预计能解决以前看到的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.16,0:02:00.01,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the first set of prototypes that had flown this high altitude flight, were the SN 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.16,0:02:00.01,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 第一组曾进行高海拔试飞的原型机是SN8 9 10和11
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.68,0:02:05.40,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they had failed because of design problems with the Starship hardware,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.68,0:02:05.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而他们失败的原因是星船设备的设计问题
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.44,0:02:09.63,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and also with design problems or fabrication problems with the Raptor engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.44,0:02:09.63,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}还有则是猛禽发动机的设计或制造问题
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.93,0:02:13.78,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And both of those had received revisions for SN15,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.93,0:02:13.78,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这两部分在SN15上都得到了改进
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.80,0:02:18.64,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and by the way, 12 through 14 were never completed and were never intended to fly.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.80,0:02:18.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同时顺便说一下 12至14号从未完成或打算飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.75,0:02:22.64,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So 15 had new plumbing and changes,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.75,0:02:22.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么15号有新的管道和其他的一些变化
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.70,0:02:24.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I think it's inside the thrust pot,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.70,0:02:24.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想这是在推力锅(推力穹顶)里面
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.38,0:02:27.92,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but we're not too clear on exactly what changes happened,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.38,0:02:27.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我们并不太清楚到底发生了什么变化
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.95,0:02:30.95,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}or at least if we have a few clues as to what might have changed,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.95,0:02:30.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}或者至少知道一点点线索
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.02,0:02:35.71,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but by no means an exhaustive list of things or why.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.02,0:02:35.71,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但绝不详尽 也没有原因
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.96,0:02:39.15,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The Raptors were also redesigned and upgraded
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.96,0:02:39.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}猛禽也被重新设计并升级了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.22,0:02:44.33,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and boy, it looks like those combination of upgrades may have actually made it work,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.22,0:02:44.33,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而老兄啊 看起来这些升级的组合可能真的能起作用
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.47,0:02:46.24,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}although it wasn't 100% perfect.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.47,0:02:46.24,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}尽管这并不是完美的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.28,0:02:49.22,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We did have problems here and there, and we'll talk about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.28,0:02:49.22,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}待会我们会讨论这之中发生的一些问题
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.25,0:02:54.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now, the flight should have been absolutely spectacular, but we didn't see all of it,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.25,0:02:54.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 飞行绝对应该是壮观的 但我们并没有全部看到
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.44,0:02:57.79,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because there was a cloud layer at about 1000 feet.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.44,0:02:57.79,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为云层在大约300米处
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.16,0:03:02.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So all those wonderful people who bring their cameras out to watch this spectacle,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.16,0:03:02.26,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 所有那些带着相机出来观看这一奇观的好人
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.29,0:03:04.51,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they got to see this amazing launch.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.29,0:03:04.51,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}都看到了这惊人的发射
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.80,0:03:07.18,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You've got to see the vehicle lift slowly off the pad
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.80,0:03:07.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你能看到航天器缓慢离开发射台
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.21,0:03:10.98,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then disappear into the cloud layer for several minutes,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.21,0:03:10.98,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后在云层中消失数分钟
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.10,0:03:15.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then appeared back out from the clouds, rockets firing and landed safely.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.10,0:03:15.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后又从云层中出现 火箭点火并安全着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.88,0:03:18.03,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that was pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.88,0:03:18.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而那是相当好的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.22,0:03:23.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So anything above the clouds, we pretty much had to rely on SpaceX's on board cameras,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.22,0:03:23.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 任何在云上的景象都要依靠SpaceX的箭载相机来看
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.34,0:03:27.46,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it looked like they had made some effort to upgrade the quality.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.34,0:03:27.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且看起来他们已经做了一些努力来提升质量
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.48,0:03:29.90,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Their livestream was in 4K I notice.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.48,0:03:29.90,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我注意到他们的现场直播是4K分辨率的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.27,0:03:34.11,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the camera that we were seeing from inside the skirt
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.27,0:03:34.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而裙板里的相机
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.27,0:03:37.91,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}actually showed a lot more detail on the edges and on the Raptor.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.27,0:03:37.91,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}实际上给裙板的边缘还有猛禽都展现了更多的细节
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.92,0:03:39.23,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Things looked a lot better.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.92,0:03:39.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}看起来好多了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.78,0:03:43.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But there were all sorts of problems with the signal,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.78,0:03:43.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但信号出现了各种问题
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.34,0:03:47.71,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the video kept on freezing for several minutes at a time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.34,0:03:47.71,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且视频每次都会冻结几分钟
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.98,0:03:50.09,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We would sometimes get snippets of video
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.98,0:03:50.09,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们有时能看到一些视频片段
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.11,0:03:56.07,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then it would go away, or we might get just motion vectors, and the mush flying around.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.11,0:03:56.07,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后就会消失 或者可能会看到发动机矢量的运动 以及烟雾的运动
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.82,0:03:59.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And this meant that we did miss most of the flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.82,0:03:59.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这意味着我们确实错过了大部分的飞行过程
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.40,0:04:01.51,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We did get to see that the engine shut off.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.40,0:04:01.51,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们确实看到了发动机关闭的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.19,0:04:04.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But I think my favorite moment from the flight was
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.19,0:04:04.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在飞行中 我最喜欢的时刻是
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.37,0:04:11.70,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they had now fitted a camera to one of the fins on the vehicle.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.37,0:04:11.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在他们在航天器的一个翼面上安装了相机
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.20,0:04:15.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And these fins, they move up and down to adjust the aerodynamic drag,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.20,0:04:15.60,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这些翼面可以上下移动以调整空气阻力
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.64,0:04:18.28,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and therefore adjust the horizontal orientation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.64,0:04:18.28,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并以此调整水平姿态
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.99,0:04:23.73,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you got to see the horizon tilting as these fins moved.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.99,0:04:23.73,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以你可以看到地平线随着这些翼面的移动而倾斜
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.50,0:04:30.05,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But also, during one sequence, they were falling with their plume, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.50,0:04:30.05,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但同样地 在一段视频中 航天器落入了云雾 对吧
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.08,0:04:32.62,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The cloud plume that they had made on the way up,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.08,0:04:32.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也就是其在上升过程中产生的云层
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.78,0:04:37.31,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it was behind them, so we actually got to see this falling down past,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.78,0:04:37.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}就在其身后 那么实际上我们看到了其从中坠落的过程
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.33,0:04:41.86,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it looked amazing at this all depth and quality to it that had never quite seen.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.33,0:04:41.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且这样好的深度和质量是以前的影像中从未见过的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.40,0:04:46.31,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yeah it seemed that the video quality might have been related to the fact
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.40,0:04:46.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是 是的 视频质量似乎与这些事情有关
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.36,0:04:50.20,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that they were maybe testing delivering video over their Starlink network.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.36,0:04:50.20,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也许他们正在测试使用他们的Starlink网络来传输视频
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.85,0:04:53.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So a few weeks ago,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.85,0:04:53.02,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么几周前
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.05,0:04:57.73,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SpaceX had applied to fly a Starlink antenna on the side of a Starship.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.05,0:04:57.73,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs80}SpaceX已经申请在一艘星船的侧面安装一个Starlink天线 并在试飞中使用
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.45,0:05:02.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And well, I mean, they were approved, you can actually see it on the side.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.45,0:05:02.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}恩 我是指 这件事被批准了 实际上你可以在侧面看到它
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.86,0:05:06.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I guess it didn't target so well, or there's problems still to be worked out.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.86,0:05:06.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我猜它的指向不是那么好 或者还有问题需要解决
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.40,0:05:14.98,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}During the flight, we also see IP addresses like you see udp://234.70.253.161:9000.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.40,0:05:14.98,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在飞行过程中 我们还看到了IP地址 比如{\fs70}udp://234.70.253.161:9000
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.27,0:05:20.27,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's like, UDP video streaming that they were pulling data from.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.27,0:05:20.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这差不多是 他们正在拉取的UDP视频流
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.78,0:05:22.54,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And 234 address range,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.78,0:05:22.54,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这个234的地址范围
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.54,0:05:27.22,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I believe that's actually a public multicast address that might have been visible on the Internet,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.54,0:05:27.22,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我相信这实际上是一个公共组播地址 可能在互联网上可见
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.22,0:05:30.88,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but I doubt it, like, just because it's a publicly routable address
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.22,0:05:30.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我怀疑 就因为它是一个可路由的地址
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.90,0:05:35.51,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}doesn't mean that it would actually be visible to the public. Let's say.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.90,0:05:35.51,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并不意味着它实际上是公开的 可以这么说
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.02,0:05:38.01,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.02,0:05:38.01,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我不清楚
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.16,0:05:43.03,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}By the way, we knew it was VLC, which is a open source media player,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.16,0:05:43.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}顺便说一下 我们知道这是VLC 一个开源的媒体播放器
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.04,0:05:48.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because the font pretty much matched what VLC uses, but I thought that was kind of cute.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.04,0:05:48.48,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为其字体与VLC使用的字体几乎一致 但我认为这有点可爱
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.50,0:05:50.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SpaceX just using what works right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.50,0:05:50.57,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SpaceX就使用有效的东西 对吧
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.92,0:05:57.51,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now one important bit that we sort of glitched out a little was when the engines lit
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.92,0:05:57.51,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么有一个重要的部分 差点被忽略了 就是当发动机点燃的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.98,0:06:05.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because in previous flights and according to John Insprucker, the plan this time was to fire three engines,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.98,0:06:05.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs70}因为在以前的飞行中 同时根据John Insprucker的说法 这次的计划是点燃三台发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.53,0:06:09.03,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then downselect to two engines for orientation to the vertical.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.53,0:06:09.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后选择两台发动机用于向垂直姿态的转变
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.59,0:06:12.10,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then switch to a single engine for the landing.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.59,0:06:12.10,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后改用单台发动机进行着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.10,0:06:16.31,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But in this case, it looks like the only lit two engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.10,0:06:16.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这次 似乎只点燃了两台发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.36,0:06:21.36,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It looks to me and most other people, the third engine immediately swung out of the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.36,0:06:21.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在我和其他大多数人看来 第三台发动机立刻摆开了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.74,0:06:27.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it's not clear whether that one engine was voted out before it was even lit,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.74,0:06:27.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以不清楚那台发动机是否在点火前就被淘汰了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.07,0:06:30.27,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}whether it was ruled out due to something prior to ignition.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.07,0:06:30.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是否由于点火前的一些原因而被排除了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.30,0:06:33.06,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But I think that one would have been one of the first ones to ignite,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.30,0:06:33.06,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我认为那台发动机应该是最先被点燃的发动机之一
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.14,0:06:37.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it's one of the engines, towards the belly of the vehicle,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.14,0:06:37.60,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为它是朝向航天器腹部的发动机之一
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.63,0:06:41.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and therefore actually provides slightly more lever arm.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.63,0:06:41.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此实际上其力矩稍多
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.78,0:06:43.93,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because of the orientation of the fins,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.78,0:06:43.93,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为翼面的指向
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.23,0:06:49.43,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}whereas the two that did light, or one of the ones that did light, didn't do that quite as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.23,0:06:49.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而那两台点燃的 或其中一台点燃的发动机 并不能做得一样好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.46,0:06:55.76,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So we had two engines were working, which wouldn't be the first choice of a pair of engines to land.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.46,0:06:55.76,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么有两台在工作的发动机不是原定着陆要用的一对发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.29,0:06:58.67,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It also came in and down a lot faster.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.29,0:06:58.67,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它进入垂直姿态并下降的速度也快了很多
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.68,0:07:03.99,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If you do look at pixel counts, compared to SN10 which was their successful landing,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.68,0:07:03.99,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你真的去数像素 与SN10 也就是之前的*成功*着陆相比
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.99,0:07:09.79,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It was coming down faster and higher and breaking faster as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.99,0:07:09.79,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}SN15下来的(初)速度更快 高度更高 减速度也更大
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.83,0:07:13.64,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}although it managed to throttle down and safely land.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.83,0:07:13.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}尽管它成功地节流并安全着陆
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.45,0:07:19.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Based on my pixel counts, it was moving at less than three meters per second, less than 10 feet per second,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.45,0:07:19.60,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}根据我的像素计数 它的移动速度不到3m/s(10ft/s)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.67,0:07:27.42,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}as opposed to SN10 which we know was about 10 meters per second or 33 feet per second
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.67,0:07:27.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}与SN10相比 我们知道它的速度大概是10m/s(33ft/s)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.45,0:07:32.13,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}depending upon what your unit preference is.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.45,0:07:32.13,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这将取决于你的单位偏好
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.32,0:07:37.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The landing wasn't totally clean by any means.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.32,0:07:37.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}着陆并不完美
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.54,0:07:42.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We can now see on the pad that there were black marks where the feet had hit,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.54,0:07:42.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们现在可以在着陆场上看到 在着陆腿落地的地方有黑色的痕迹
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.92,0:07:46.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then they slid sideways a couple of feet.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.92,0:07:46.36,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后还向侧面滑行了几米
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.86,0:07:50.65,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Also. seems pretty close to the edge of the pad.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.86,0:07:50.65,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}另外 着陆似乎非常接近着陆场的边缘
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.97,0:07:54.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can actually see, by the way, from the skirt camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.97,0:07:54.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}顺便说一下 你实际上可以从裙板内的相机看到
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.96,0:07:56.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}As it comes down and performs this transition,

Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.98,0:07:59.98,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}可以从高处看到储罐场的情况
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.23,0:08:02.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then you get to see sections of the landing pad,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.23,0:08:02.68,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后你就可以看到着陆场的各个部分
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.70,0:08:04.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you can see in the background,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.70,0:08:04.27,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以在背景中看到
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.29,0:08:06.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}just the little of fire hose there
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.29,0:08:06.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到一点消防水管
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.18,0:08:10.45,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that was going to be needed for the post flight fire.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.47,0:08:16.61,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Yeah they landed and there was immediately lots of methane burning out the side.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.47,0:08:16.61,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 他们降落后 立即有很多甲烷从侧面燃烧起来
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.89,0:08:20.21,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Wasn't clear how much of this was actually a leak,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.89,0:08:20.21,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不清楚这其中有多少是真的泄漏
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.46,0:08:24.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}or whether this was just stuff left open in the pipes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.46,0:08:24.06,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}或者只是管道里的残余气体
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.49,0:08:28.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Whether there was a valve that failed to close, and they had to figure that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.49,0:08:28.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是否有个阀门失效了 没法关闭 所以他们必须要弄清楚这一点

Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.70,0:11:36.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我们知道 他们比国家队的方案更贵
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.09,0:11:42.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And of course NASA because it had these protests in hand,

Dialogue: 0,0:13:05.66,0:13:08.98,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们实际上在测试点火时丢失了几片隔热瓦
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.32,0:13:15.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it looks like if they lost any, they weren't particularly obvious during the the actual flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.32,0:13:15.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但看起来 在实际飞行过程中 可能没有丢失隔热瓦
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.69,0:13:19.86,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Test fires might actually be a slightly more dangerous environment
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.69,0:13:19.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}测试点火实际上可能是一个稍微更危险的环境
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.90,0:13:24.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it's spending more time on the pad as opposed to in flight,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.90,0:13:24.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为相比于飞行中 它花了更多的时间在发射台上
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.81,0:13:27.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and of course you get reflection of sound and waves from the ground
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.81,0:13:27.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当然你会得到来自地面的声波的反射

Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.36,0:13:35.03,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}By the way, a lot people have been asking
Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.36,0:13:35.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}顺便说一下 很多人一直在问
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.09,0:13:38.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}why there are tiles being tested on the back of the fins,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.09,0:13:38.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}为什么在翼面的背面有隔热瓦进行测试？
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.40,0:13:43.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because the plan is to have the front of the vehicle that will go through re-entry to have their tiles,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.40,0:13:43.91,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为计划是让飞行器的正面通过再入大气层时存在隔热瓦保护
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.94,0:13:50.65,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and for the labored side to have nothing, just to have the silver shiny finish of the stainless steel
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.94,0:13:50.65,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而背风面应该没有任何东西 只有银色闪亮的不锈钢表面
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.83,0:13:54.25,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}to reflect the incidental thermal radiation back into space.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.83,0:13:54.25,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}来反射次要的热辐射到太空中
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.54,0:13:59.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And so people will assume that that might be true of the fins.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.54,0:13:59.14,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 人们可能会认为翼面也是如此
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.42,0:14:02.09,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}However, the fins are in a slightly different situation,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.42,0:14:02.09,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然而 翼面的情况略有不同
Dialogue: 0,0:14:02.10,0:14:04.33,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}first of all, they're actuating it to different angles.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:02.10,0:14:04.33,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}首先 他们正以不同的角度来驱动它
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.68,0:14:08.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they may actually end up getting heat reflected from the body,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.68,0:14:08.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且它们实际上可能最终得到来自机身的热量反射
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.21,0:14:12.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but also just because you've got this sort of high pressure air being pushed around,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.21,0:14:12.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但也正是因为其被这种高压空气推来推去
Dialogue: 0,0:14:12.66,0:14:16.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it's entirely possible, you might have more heating on the back of the fins.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:12.66,0:14:16.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也完全有可能会在翼面的背面经受更多的热量
Dialogue: 0,0:14:16.22,0:14:20.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And finally, the fins are relatively thin, compared to the body,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:16.22,0:14:20.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而最后 与机身相比 翼面相对较薄
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.55,0:14:22.66,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so there's a lot less thermal mass there.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.55,0:14:22.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以那里的热质量要小得多
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.12,0:14:28.12,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Therefore, they might actually need to have thermal protection on the back of all the fins
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.12,0:14:28.12,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 实际上他们可能需要在所有的翼面的背面都加上热保护措施
Dialogue: 0,0:14:28.20,0:14:29.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}to get them through re-entry.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:28.20,0:14:29.44,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}以使其扛过大气层再入
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.76,0:14:32.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I don't know. Somebody's probably modeled this in a lot more detail,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.76,0:14:32.37,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不知道 有人可能已经对这个问题进行了更详细的建模
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.38,0:14:37.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but since they're putting the tiles there, I expect they're considering this as a possibility.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.38,0:14:37.57,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但既然他们把隔热瓦放在那里 我想他们会考虑这种可能性
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.98,0:14:42.96,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The Raptor engine plumes looked much more consistent than previous flights.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.98,0:14:42.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}相比以前的飞行 猛禽发动机的尾流看起来要稳定得多
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.00,0:14:45.79,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Usually we'd have one that was slightly orange,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.00,0:14:45.79,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}通常情况下 会看到有一台的颜色略微有点发黄
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.82,0:14:48.21,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and we'd be thinking, oh, that's a little bit about fuel rich.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.82,0:14:48.21,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我们会想 哦 那是有点富燃的燃气
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.49,0:14:50.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But there were much, much closer.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.49,0:14:50.26,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是这次各台发动机之间的颜色却非常接近
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.31,0:14:54.01,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Although there were definitely moments where they were running with off nominal mixtures,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.31,0:14:54.01,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}虽然有些时候 肯定在使用非额定的混合比
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.10,0:14:55.82,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}probably for thrust reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.10,0:14:55.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}可能是节流的原因
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.71,0:15:00.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So congratulations to SpaceX and everyone involved in Starship.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.54,0:15:10.06,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且这样巨大的第一步也表明 它确实可以工作
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.43,0:15:15.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and I hope that when SN16 flies that it similarly continues this tradition.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.43,0:15:15.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同时我希望 在SN16飞行时 它同样可以继续这一传统
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.58,0:15:22.93,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we can actually demonstrate that the level of reliability needed to make Starship work is achievable.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.58,0:15:22.93,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且我们可以实际验证 使星船工作所需的可靠性水平是可以实现的
Dialogue: 0,0:15:23.77,0:15:28.03,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yes, that will be in the future, we'll see SN16 fly in a couple of weeks,

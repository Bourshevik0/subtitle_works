Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.20,0:00:48.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and Atlas and Delta have been the sort of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.20,0:00:48.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而宇宙神和德尔塔一直是那种
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.87,0:00:54.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they've been at the core of rocket launches in the US going back to the 1950s.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.87,0:00:54.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}自20世纪50年代起 他们一直是美国火箭发射的核心
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.80,0:01:01.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Both of these rockets have their roots in ICBM or ballistic missile development.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.80,0:01:01.68,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这两种火箭都源自洲际弹道导弹或弹道导弹的发展
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.82,0:01:04.87,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The Thor and the Delta essentially happened in parallel.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.82,0:01:04.87,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}雷神和德尔塔基本上是同时产生的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.87,0:01:10.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They started building the intracontinental Atlas ICBM, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.87,0:01:10.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们开始建造宇宙神洲际弹道导弹 对吧
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.78,0:01:14.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they realized that it's complex engine staging system
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.78,0:01:14.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同时他们意识到 其复杂的发动机分级系统
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.42,0:01:17.21,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}where two of the engines had to drop off and the third kept running
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.42,0:01:17.21,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其中两个发动机必须关闭 第三个发动机则继续运行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.45,0:01:20.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}was gonna delay things. Make things take a little longer.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.45,0:01:20.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样的飞行时序会延长发射所需时间
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.90,0:01:27.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they spun up a program to develop another shorter range rocket called Thor that had a single engine
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.90,0:01:27.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs80}所以他们启动了一个计划 开发另一种只带有一台发动机的短程火箭 叫做雷神
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.64,0:01:30.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and instead of having to cross huge continental distances
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.64,0:01:30.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样的火箭不需要横跨洲际的距离
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.00,0:01:33.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they would fly them on planes out to England
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.00,0:01:33.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而是先用飞机运到英国
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.60,0:01:36.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and station them there where they could strike Russia.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.60,0:01:36.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}驻扎在那里 就可以打击俄罗斯了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.86,0:01:41.89,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now after these things were superseded they got turned into launch vehicles
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.86,0:01:41.89,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 在这些东西被取代后 它们被变成了运载火箭
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.93,0:01:47.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so obviously Atlas just evolved over time through various iterations into the Atlas V.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.93,0:01:47.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs85}所以很明显 随着时间的推移 宇宙神通过各种迭代演变成了宇宙神五号
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.29,0:01:53.89,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The Thor began as the Thor launch system and then they had second stages.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.29,0:01:53.89,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}雷神开始是雷神发射系统 然后加上了二级
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.34,0:01:57.47,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And eventually one of the second stages was called Delta
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.34,0:01:57.47,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最后 其中一个二级被称为德尔塔
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.48,0:02:02.19,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so it became the Thor-Delta system and eventually it just became Delta.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.48,0:02:02.19,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以它变成了雷神-德尔塔系统 最后它变成了德尔塔
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.59,0:02:07.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So Delta III was the last one that was really closely based on that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.59,0:02:07.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么德尔塔三是最后一个真正基于此的系统
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.11,0:02:10.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Delta IV was quite a departure I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.11,0:02:10.92,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我认为德尔塔四是一个相当大的变化
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.96,0:02:16.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The only thing that was really in common between Delta III and Delta 4 was the fairing design
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.96,0:02:16.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}德尔塔三和德尔塔四之间唯一的共同点是整流罩的设计
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.64,0:02:19.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and one version of the second stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.64,0:02:19.06,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}以及其中一种二级
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.42,0:02:24.32,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But regardless these things are going to stop flying in the next decade
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.42,0:02:24.32,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但无论如何 这些东西将在未来十年内停止飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.34,0:02:26.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it means that going forward
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.34,0:02:26.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这意味着 在未来
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.20,0:02:34.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}almost all the US launch capability will be based on launch vehicles which were not built as ICBMs anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.20,0:02:34.08,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs85}几乎所有美国的发射能力都将基于不再作为洲际弹道导弹建造的运载火箭
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.08,0:02:36.87,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}These have been built as commercial launch vehicles.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.08,0:02:36.87,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些都是作为商业运载火箭建造的
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.99,0:02:39.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Certainly there's a few ICBM derivatives there
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.99,0:02:39.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 那里有一些洲际弹道导弹的衍生品
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.89,0:02:41.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but this is huge.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.89,0:02:41.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但德尔塔和宇宙神代表的是中大型运载火箭
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.31,0:02:51.03,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the reason for this retirement is that the Atlas V uses Russian RD-180 engines
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.31,0:02:51.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以退役的原因是 宇宙神五号使用俄罗斯的RD-180发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.05,0:02:52.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they use those engines
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.05,0:02:52.00,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且他们使用这些发动机的原因是
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.00,0:02:58.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they are arguably the best engines in the world for kerosene and liquid oxygen propellant.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.00,0:02:58.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些发动机可以说是世界上最好的煤油和液氧推进剂的发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.15,0:03:00.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They get amazing thrust-to-weight ratio.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.15,0:03:00.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其有惊人的推重比
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.29,0:03:04.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They get the best specific impulse.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.29,0:03:04.75,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最好的比冲
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.78,0:03:06.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They have great throttle control.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.78,0:03:06.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}节流控制也不错
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.59,0:03:08.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They're objectively amazing in every way.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.59,0:03:08.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}客观地说 它们在各方面都很出色
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.95,0:03:14.22,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The only thing you might argue is the Merlin engines used on SpaceX's Falcon 9s
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.95,0:03:14.22,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可能争论的唯一一点是SpaceX的猎鹰9号上使用的梅林发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.82,0:03:19.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}have probably better throttle control and they have better thrust-to-weight ratio
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.82,0:03:19.04,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}可能有更好的节流控制 以及更好的推重比
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.06,0:03:22.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but really those are only useful if you're landing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.06,0:03:22.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但实际上 这些只有在你要降落时才有用
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.15,0:03:24.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Yes I know. Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.15,0:03:24.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 我知道 是的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.40,0:03:29.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But anyway the RD-180s were brought in the 1990s.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.40,0:03:29.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但无论如何 RD-180是在1990年代出现的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.39,0:03:31.85,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}After the fall of the Soviet Union

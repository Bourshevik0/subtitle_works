Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.67,0:08:40.26,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但随着时间的推移 它过渡到一个较慢的旋转模式 即端部翻滚运动
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.56,0:08:42.24,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and this actually confused the engineers
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.56,0:08:42.24,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这实际上使工程师们感到困惑
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.28,0:08:47.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because conservation of energy and angular momentum should have kept it stable.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.74,0:09:11.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为这不是他喜欢的方向之一
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.06,0:09:16.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So Explorer 1 should have been stable around its original rotational axis
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.06,0:09:16.68,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以探索者1号应该是围绕其原始的旋转轴稳定的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.69,0:09:19.54,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because a change to any other rotational axis
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.69,0:09:19.54,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为如果改变任何其他的旋转轴
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.80,0:09:23.08,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,would require it to change its rotational kinetic energy

Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.94,0:09:27.54,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and that in a vacuum is hard right where's it getting rid of it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.94,0:09:27.54,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这在真空中是很难做到的 它在哪里能摆脱它呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.55,0:09:32.69,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but it turns out that after it was released it deployed flexible antenna
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.55,0:09:32.69,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但事实证明 在它被释放后 它部署了灵活的天线
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.18,0:09:36.81,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and as these were perturbed they would flex
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.18,0:09:36.81,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,当这些天线受到扰动时 它们会弯曲
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.84,0:09:41.12,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and the flexing would actually convert a small amount of the kinetic energy into heat
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.84,0:09:41.12,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,弯曲实际上会把少量的动能转换成热能
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.38,0:09:45.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and as it did this it meant that the thing had to rotate more slowly
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.38,0:09:45.50,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,当它这样做的时候 意味着这个东西必须更慢地旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.72,0:09:48.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and to rotate more slowly it had to change its rotational axis
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.72,0:09:48.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,为了旋转得更慢 它必须改变它的旋转轴线
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.95,0:09:55.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so over time these flexible antennas drove the rotation into the slower end over end state.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.95,0:09:55.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因此 随着时间的推移 这些灵活的天线促使旋转进入较慢的端对端状态
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.14,0:09:59.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,And that's actually important for modern satellite design

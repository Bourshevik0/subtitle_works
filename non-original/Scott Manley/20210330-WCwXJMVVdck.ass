Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.53,0:01:56.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so there's a lot more of the movie which I'm not going to cover until after it's released
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.53,0:01:56.91,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以电影还有很多内容 我不打算在它发布后再介绍

Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.83,0:02:22.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,which means the crew is going to be faced with some really tough decisions
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.83,0:02:22.40,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,这意味着船员们将面临一些非常艰难的决定
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.40,0:02:24.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,that will really stretch their acting skills.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.75,0:02:32.85,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Now anybody that knows science fiction will recognize the parallels with the classic story the cold equations.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.75,0:02:32.85,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,现在 任何了解科幻小说的人都会认识到与经典故事《冷酷方程式》的相似之处
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.12,0:02:36.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Originally published in the 1950s it's a classic story
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.12,0:02:36.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,它最初发表于20世纪50年代 是一个经典故事

Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.38,0:02:47.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so yes the story very much falls into this mode
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.38,0:02:47.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因此 是的 这个故事在很大程度上属于这种模式
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.05,0:02:50.99,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,although it's worth noting that the cold equations itself
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.05,0:02:50.99,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,尽管值得注意的是 冷酷的方程式本身
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.02,0:02:54.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,isn't actually the first example of this particular storyline.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.31,0:03:19.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而你们中的一些人立即将这部电影斥为幻想
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.71,0:03:22.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because artificial gravity isn't a realistic technology
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.71,0:03:22.94,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为人工重力并不是一项现实的技术
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.40,0:03:28.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but if you look carefully at the trailer there is an explanation already in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.40,0:03:28.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但如果你仔细看一下预告片 里面已经有了解释

Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.71,0:04:25.73,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but it was enough to show the concept.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.71,0:04:25.73,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但它足以显示这个概念
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.47,0:04:32.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So in stowaway this thing is scaled up to a multi-module space habitat

Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.09,0:04:56.24,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,the new writers they arrived at this design long after starting on the basic story
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.09,0:04:56.24,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,新的编剧在开始创作基本故事后很久才想到这个设计
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.24,0:05:02.54,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because they realized that shooting a movie set in zero G would make a much more expensive production
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.24,0:05:02.54,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为他们意识到 在零重力环境下拍摄电影会使制作成本大大增加
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.95,0:05:05.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so they wanted to try to keep the cost down
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.95,0:05:05.05,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以他们想尽量减少成本
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.52,0:05:07.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so the first of all they wanted okay gravity
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.52,0:05:07.96,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以他们首先想要的是好的重力
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.00,0:05:11.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,let's have a ring-shaped spacecraft to generate artificial gravity

Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.14,0:05:12.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but there's two problems with this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.14,0:05:12.42,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但这有两个问题
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.77,0:05:16.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,One is that if you make the spacecraft small enough
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.77,0:05:16.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,一个是 如果你把航天器做得足够小
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.93,0:05:22.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,then the curvature is quite extreme which means that you then have to build a set that has big curves on it
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.93,0:05:22.75,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么曲率就会很极端 这意味着你必须建造一个有大曲线的装置
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.88,0:05:26.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and then you have to deal with the fact that people might need to walk around it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.88,0:05:26.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,然后 你必须处理人们可能需要在它周围行走的事实
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.47,0:05:35.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Now for the movie 2001 they actually built a 27 ton centrifuge set for the main bridge of the discovery
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.47,0:05:35.52,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,现在 在电影《2001》中 他们实际上为发现的主桥建造了一个27吨的离心机组

Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.47,0:05:43.28,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and there's a couple of scenes in the movie where there's one actor walking around the bottom as it rotates
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.47,0:05:43.28,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,在电影中 有几场戏是这样的：一个演员在底部旋转时走动
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.67,0:05:48.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and there's another actor basically strapped into their seat so they can go upside down.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.67,0:05:48.34,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而另一个演员基本上被绑在他们的座位上 所以他们可以倒立
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.03,0:05:51.28,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Obviously this is some amazing film making.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.03,0:05:51.28,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,显然 这是一些惊人的电影制作
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:05:57.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,I mean it's Stanley Kubrick, a director who would go to great lengths to shoot things the way he wanted.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.28,0:05:57.06,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,我的意思是 这是斯坦利-库布里克 一个会不遗余力地按照他想要的方式来拍摄的导演
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.10,0:06:00.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,There's a joke that if Stanley Kubrick had been asked to fake the moon landings

Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.02,0:06:03.66,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,he would have insisted on shooting it on the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.02,0:06:03.66,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,他一定会坚持在月球上拍摄
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.24,0:06:06.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,But anyway yeah this costs a lot of money
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.24,0:06:06.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但无论如何 这要花很多钱
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.08,0:06:12.69,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but also from a scientific point of view the small ring also would need to rotate faster
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.08,0:06:12.69,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但从科学的角度来看 小环也需要更快旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.73,0:06:15.20,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and that actually causes problems with the crew.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.73,0:06:15.20,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这实际上会给工作人员带来问题
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.23,0:06:17.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,They get dizzy because if they stand up and sit down
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.23,0:06:17.91,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,他们会感到头晕 因为如果他们站起来和坐下来
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.91,0:06:20.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,the rotation actually changes between their heads and their feet
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.91,0:06:20.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,旋转实际上在他们的头和他们的脚之间发生变化
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.84,0:06:23.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and that makes them gives them nausea.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.84,0:06:23.05,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这让他们感到恶心
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.85,0:06:27.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So if you then said well why don't we scale up the radius of the habitat
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.85,0:06:27.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因此 如果你说 我们为什么不扩大栖息地的半径呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.97,0:06:30.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so you don't need to have curved sets and things like that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.97,0:06:30.23,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,这样你就不需要有弯曲的套装和类似的东西了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.30,0:06:32.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and the rotation is slower and the human body is fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.30,0:06:32.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而且旋转的速度更慢 人体就会很好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.40,0:06:36.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,That solves those problems but then you have the problem of explaining
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.40,0:06:36.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,这就解决了这些问题 但是你又有一个问题 那就是如何解释
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.10,0:06:41.47,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,why the crew is so small on this massive ring spacecraft
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.10,0:06:41.47,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,为什么在这个巨大的环形飞船上 船员人数如此之少？
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.86,0:06:45.73,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because having a small crew means a small number of cast members
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.86,0:06:45.73,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为有一个小的船员意味着有少量的演员
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.76,0:06:47.85,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but also from a storytelling perspective
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.76,0:06:47.85,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但从讲故事的角度来看
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.87,0:06:53.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,it's much more plausible that if your crew is supposed to be three and you have one extra
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.87,0:06:53.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,如果你的船员应该是三个人 而你却多了一个人 这就更有说服力了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.50,0:06:56.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,that's a much bigger deal than if your crew is say 10.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.50,0:06:56.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,这比你的船员是10人要大得多
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.79,0:07:00.97,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,I think an early version of the script actually had four crew members and a stowaway
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.79,0:07:00.97,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,我认为剧本的早期版本实际上有四个船员和一个偷渡者
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.02,0:07:04.99,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and this was paired back to make the scenario more plausible.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.02,0:07:04.99,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这是为了使剧情更加合理而配上的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.44,0:07:09.13,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So that's more or less how the riders came to this idea
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.44,0:07:09.13,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以 这或多或少是骑手们的想法

Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.97,0:07:21.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and moreover once this design was settled on it actually drove other aspects of the storytelling
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.97,0:07:21.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,此外 一旦这个设计被确定下来 它实际上推动了故事的其他方面的发展

Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.31,0:07:35.39,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Anyway I guess one contribution I can say that I did make was that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.31,0:07:35.39,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,总之 我想我可以说的一个贡献是 我确实做出了贡献
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.42,0:07:38.96,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,I suggested in the design that they have a utility module in the middle

Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.96,0:07:42.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because that's the place where the rotational forces are the lowest
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.96,0:07:42.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为那是旋转力最小的地方
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.98,0:07:46.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so that's the best place to put your solar panels for your power generation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.98,0:07:46.37,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以那是放置太阳能板发电的最佳位置
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.03,0:07:53.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Anyway during my work on this I generated some of the first renderings of the design as a reference.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.43,0:00:05.81,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Hello, its Scott Manley here.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.43,0:00:05.81,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你好 我是Scott Manley
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.10,0:00:09.33,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Many of you have gone to see the Apollo 11 documentary
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.10,0:00:09.33,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你们中的许多人都去看了阿波罗11号的纪录片
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.33,0:00:13.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and man if you have agreed with my assessment that it is very much worth seeing
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.33,0:00:13.55,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}兄啊 如果你同意我的评价 认为这是非常值得看的话 (那就很好)
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.14,0:00:16.39,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but also some of you have had some questions
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.14,0:00:16.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但也有一些人有一些问题
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.42,0:00:20.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and there's one particular question which I did not know the answer to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.42,0:00:20.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且有一个特别的问题 我之前并不知道它的答案
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.82,0:00:23.71,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And I was equally perplexed when I saw the footage.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.82,0:00:23.71,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当我看到这段录像时 也同样感到困惑
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.23,0:00:30.65,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So what did it this shows is the lighting of the third stage of the Saturn V.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.23,0:00:30.65,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么它这显示的是土星五号三级的点火
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.67,0:00:34.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That is the S-IVB upper stage
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.67,0:00:34.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那就是S-IVB上面级
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.34,0:00:41.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is a hundred-plus ton hydrogen oxygen stage propelled by a single J-2 engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.34,0:00:41.05,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个一百多吨的氢氧级 由一台J-2发动机推动
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.57,0:00:45.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This gets the spacecraft into its initial parking orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.57,0:00:45.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这使航天器进入最初的停泊轨道
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.63,0:00:48.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then after a couple of orbits they relit it
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.63,0:00:48.10,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后在几圈轨道后 他们再重新点燃它
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.14,0:00:53.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that would carry the spacecraft all the way up into translunar injection.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.14,0:00:53.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这将携带航天器一路上升到月球转移轨道
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.51,0:00:56.93,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It was a very short clip and I thought it might have been shot from the ground
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.51,0:00:56.93,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个非常短的片段 我想它可能是从地面上拍摄的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.98,0:00:59.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but that wouldn't have been possible with Apollo 11
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.98,0:00:59.55,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但如果是阿波罗11号 就不可能了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.55,0:01:04.33,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because the engine was relit in the dark side of the earth and so we wouldn't have seen that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.55,0:01:04.33,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为发动机是在地球黑暗的一面重新点燃的 所以我们看不到的(至少看不到箭体)
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.25,0:01:09.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but the movie had been quite happy borrowing some footage from other missions.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.25,0:01:09.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但电影却很乐意借用其他任务的一些镜头
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.66,0:01:15.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Most notably this stage separations were from engineering cameras which were not carried on Apollo 11.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.66,0:01:15.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最值得注意的是这个分级是来自工程摄像机 而这些摄像机并没有在阿波罗11号上携带
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.93,0:01:22.17,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}In fact this very famous shot isn't even from a Saturn V. It is from a Saturn IB.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.93,0:01:22.17,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}事实上 这个非常著名的镜头甚至不是来自土星五号 而是来自土星一B
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.51,0:01:25.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can tell because the interstage isn't tapered
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.51,0:01:25.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看出来 因为级间段并不是锥形的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.18,0:01:31.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and because it has three stage separation Rockets before the main J-2 engine lights up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.18,0:01:31.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同时因为它在J-2主发动机点火前有三个分离火箭
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.34,0:01:34.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The Saturn V version used a different configuration
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.34,0:01:34.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}土星五号的版本采用了不同的配置
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.17,0:01:37.40,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they needed to be able to relight the engine later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.17,0:01:37.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为发动机需要在之后再进行点火
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.73,0:01:43.47,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Anyway it's kind of cool that these images they come from a film camera that was located inside there
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.73,0:01:43.47,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不管怎么说 这些图像是很酷的 它们来自于一台就放置在那个位置的胶片相机
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.84,0:01:47.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it was designed to be ejected and recovered later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.84,0:01:47.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且它被设计成可以被弹射出去 然后再回收
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.10,0:01:50.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If you skip to the end of this segment
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.10,0:01:50.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你跳到这段的最后
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.07,0:01:56.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}then you get to see the camera starting to leave the interstage just as it's film runs out
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.07,0:01:56.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你就会看到摄像机在它的胶片用完的时候 开始离开级间段
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.39,0:02:00.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so the cameras would then parachute back into the ocean and be recovered
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.39,0:02:00.36,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样 在这之后相机就会使用降落伞落到海里 然后再被回收
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.70,0:02:04.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}although I believe in one case they parachuted into the middle of a storm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.70,0:02:04.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}虽然我认为 在某次中 相机被降落到了风暴的中间
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.50,0:02:08.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it would be something like a month before they were recovered afterwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.50,0:02:08.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在一个月后才回收
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.06,0:02:12.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But coming back to the footage of that upper stage relighting.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.06,0:02:12.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但回到那个上面级再次点火的镜头
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.04,0:02:15.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It turns out that this is from Apollo 9.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.04,0:02:15.36,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}原来 这是阿波罗9号的画面
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.87,0:02:19.90,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So Apollo 9 was gonna be the first major test of the lunar module.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.87,0:02:19.90,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}阿波罗9号将是登月舱的第一次重大测试
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.98,0:02:22.29,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It was gonna fly around in low earth orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.98,0:02:22.29,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它将在近地轨道上飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.74,0:02:27.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and for that they needed to have the full Saturn V to launch the payload into orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.74,0:02:27.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}为此 他们需要加注土星五号来将有效载荷送入轨道
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.87,0:02:30.35,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so after they got into low earth orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.87,0:02:30.35,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以在他们进入近地轨道后
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.50,0:02:37.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the crew did the regular transposition docking and extraction of the lunar module for testing.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.50,0:02:37.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}乘员们进行了常规的换位对接和登月舱的提取测试
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.89,0:02:42.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This would actually be the only time this manoeuvre was performed in low earth orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.89,0:02:42.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这实际上是唯一一次在近地轨道上进行这个机动动作
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.90,0:02:44.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because at all the other missions
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.90,0:02:44.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为在所有其他任务中
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.77,0:02:51.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}this would be done after they had performed the translunar injection and were already on their way to the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.77,0:02:51.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这都会发生在他们完成了进入月球转移轨道的机动之后 并且处在前往月球的路上
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.39,0:02:55.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because they hadn't made that burn to send them on a course towards the moon
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.39,0:02:55.11,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为他们还没有进行那次把他们送到月球转移轨道上的点火
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.52,0:02:59.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the upper stage still had a lot of propellant left inside it
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.52,0:02:59.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}上面级还残留着大量的推进剂
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.69,0:03:05.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}{\fs38}and of course they're gonna be doing all sorts of experimental operations in the command module and the lunar module
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.69,0:03:05.74,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 在指令舱和登月舱中 他们会做各种实验性的操作
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.01,0:03:07.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so it's not a good idea
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.01,0:03:07.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这不是一个好主意
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.42,0:03:13.78,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}to have 50 tons of fuel and oxidizer sitting around in well somewhere that could just explode.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.42,0:03:13.78,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也就是呆在可能会爆炸的50吨的燃料和氧化剂周围
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.83,0:03:20.04,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the decision or the design of the mission was that they would relight the engine to test it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.83,0:03:20.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这次任务的决定或设计是 他们会重新点燃发动机来测试它的性能
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.04,0:03:23.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and send it off further away from the spacecraft
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.04,0:03:23.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并让其远离航天器
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.04,0:03:24.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that they can actually test in peace
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.04,0:03:24.91,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}以便他们能够真正安全地进行测试
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.94,0:03:29.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}without worrying about something that might say explode if they looked at the wrong way
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.94,0:03:29.43,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而不用担心如果搞错了就会爆炸的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.83,0:03:35.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and so the crew of Apollo 9 were able to document this both in photographs and in a film
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.83,0:03:35.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以阿波罗9号的乘员能够用照片和影片的形式来记录这一切
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.10,0:03:41.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}showing the engine relighting and sending the spacecraft off into a distant orbit.

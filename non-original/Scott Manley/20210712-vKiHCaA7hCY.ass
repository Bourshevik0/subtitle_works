Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.45,0:12:08.46,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果点火稍微有点困难 就需要更长的时间来预热并达到速度
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.49,0:12:12.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so gas-gas, on the other hand, you don't need these fancy injectors.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.49,0:12:12.10,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么气-气 在另一方面 你不需要这些花哨的喷注器
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.62,0:12:17.69,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The ignition and startup is very, very fast because it's already in gas form.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.62,0:12:17.69,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}点火和启动是非常非常快的 因为它已经是气体形式
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.13,0:12:21.79,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But also, if you're in zero G and you have a propellent tank
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.13,0:12:21.79,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是 如果你在零重力状态下 你有一个推进剂罐
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.81,0:12:23.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you try to drain a liquid off it,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.81,0:12:23.38,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而你试图把液体排出去
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.42,0:12:25.59,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}there's no guarantee that you're going to get liquid.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:23.42,0:12:25.59,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不能保证你会得到液体
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.62,0:12:27.76,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You might get the gas bubbles at the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.62,0:12:27.76,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可能会得到储罐顶部的气泡
Dialogue: 0,0:12:28.28,0:12:32.32,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But if you have a gas tank, you know you're gonna get gases,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:28.28,0:12:32.32,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但如果你有一个纯气体的储罐 你知道你会得到气体
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.10,0:12:38.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so this is one set of speculation that says this is what they might be using for these.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.10,0:12:38.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这是一种猜测 也就是他们可能会使用这样的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.62,0:12:43.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Yeah there's some other ideas here, by the way,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.62,0:12:43.26,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是的 还有一些别的想法 顺便说一下
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.28,0:12:47.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because Lunar Starship also has these other engines at the top,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.28,0:12:47.55,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为月球版星船在顶部也有这些类似的发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:12:47.59,0:12:51.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and there's a lot of speculation that these will be pressure fed engines as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:47.59,0:12:51.82,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有很多猜测认为这些也将是挤压式发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.86,0:12:54.03,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}just because they're trying to develop them very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.86,0:12:54.03,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}只是因为他们正试图快速开发它们
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.84,0:12:59.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They might be like scaled up version of the Kestrel engine
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.84,0:12:59.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它们可能是红隼发动机的放大版
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.33,0:13:02.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that was used on the second stage of the Falcon 1.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.33,0:13:02.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而红隼是猎鹰1号的二级发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.25,0:13:06.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Obviously, it wouldn't be using kerosene and liquid oxygen.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.25,0:13:06.70,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很明显 它不会(像之前那样)使用煤油和液氧
Dialogue: 0,0:13:06.81,0:13:08.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It will be using methlox.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:06.81,0:13:08.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而会使用液氧甲烷
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.34,0:13:09.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it would be Kestrel on meth.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.34,0:13:09.91,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此 它将是甲烷版红隼发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.91,0:13:12.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}These are needed
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.91,0:13:12.88,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这种发动机是必要的
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.05,0:13:16.37,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they don't want to use the main Raptor engines, for landing on the moon,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.05,0:13:16.37,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为着陆月球的时候不便用猛禽主发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.41,0:13:19.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because of the amount of regolith that would get blown about.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.41,0:13:19.30,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那样就会有大量的月壤被吹起
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.72,0:13:22.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it turns out, yeah, Kestrel sort of scaled engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.72,0:13:22.68,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但事实证明 是的 红隼的比例是差不多的
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.88,0:13:24.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Large numbers of them
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.88,0:13:24.10,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}使用大量的挤压循环红隼发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.37,0:13:30.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}could very easily land the several hundred ton rocket on the moon using pressure fed engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.37,0:13:30.15,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}可以非常容易地将几百吨的火箭降落在月球上
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.79,0:13:34.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So anyway, while development continues on Starship,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.79,0:13:34.43,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么无论如何 在继续开发星船的同时
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.43,0:13:36.67,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it is worth noting and realizing that
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.43,0:13:36.67,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}值得注意的是
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.92,0:13:41.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}while the vehicle look broadly similar to what we was suggested,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.92,0:13:41.95,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}虽然航天器看起来与我们所了解到的大致相似
Dialogue: 0,0:13:42.21,0:13:43.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}looks like it's fully functioning,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:42.21,0:13:43.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}看起来能完成任务
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.24,0:13:48.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it still has a lot of internal systems that are still being developed and tweaked, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.24,0:13:48.84,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但仍然有很多内部系统在开发和调整中 对吧
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.86,0:13:50.74,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's a lot of things that we can't see
Dialogue: 0,0:13:48.86,0:13:50.74,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有很多东西是我们看不到的
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.92,0:13:55.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which will evolved and develop over time before we reach the final product.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.92,0:13:55.31,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在完工之前 还会发生很多变化
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.58,0:13:58.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm Scott Manley. Fly safe.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.48,0:03:39.01,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and in the middle of the tanks is hoppy there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.48,0:03:39.01,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在储罐中间的则是{\i1}跳跳{\i0} (指Starhopper)
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.04,0:03:44.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is now where they mount all of the cameras and radars and things like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.04,0:03:44.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在他们在跳跳身上装满了摄像头和雷达之类的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.74,0:03:47.44,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So I believe this camera is attached to hoppy.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.74,0:03:47.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我相信这台摄像机是安装在跳跳上的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.44,0:03:49.18,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the great thing about this angle is

Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.28,0:04:05.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now for these small hops they're not going fast enough that they need thermal protection.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.28,0:04:05.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么它们只跳这么点的高度 所产生的速度还没有快到需要做隔热的程度
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.43,0:04:07.13,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But what they're just doing is
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.43,0:04:07.13,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但他们正在做的是

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.16,0:04:13.46,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}要测试这些隔热瓦能否使用插销固定在表面
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.78,0:04:18.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And by the way spoiler I don't think there's many tiles left attached to SN9.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.78,0:04:18.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么顺便剧透一下 我觉得SN9上面贴着的隔热瓦应该已经没留下几片了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.44,0:04:21.61,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So anyway fast forward to the actual flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.44,0:04:21.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么不管这些了 快进到实际的试飞中
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.64,0:04:25.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There was a bit of a pause in the clock at 13 seconds but they continued.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.64,0:04:25.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在倒计时到13秒的时候有一点停顿 但他们继续

Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.03,0:04:40.28,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That's what they had been authorized to do for this flight.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.03,0:04:40.28,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这就是他们被授权进行这次飞行的高度
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.32,0:04:44.24,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So obviously for a test flight taking off from the pad,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.32,0:04:44.24,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么很明显 一次从发射场起飞的试飞
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.24,0:04:49.78,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they have to use a lower propellant load than you would normally get in a fully loaded Starship.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.24,0:04:49.78,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们必须使用较少的推进剂 而不是通常情况下加满燃料的Starship
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.76,0:04:54.30,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This will have to have the header tanks because need to perform transition maneuver
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.76,0:04:54.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为需要进行(机腹翻转的)过渡机动 所以头部储箱必须有推进剂加注
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.34,0:04:57.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but there's a great shot showing all three of the engines lit up.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.34,0:04:57.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是这个镜头很好 拍下了三台发动机全部点火的状态
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.68,0:05:02.97,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they also included some on-board cameras including this one off the bay.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.68,0:05:02.97,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}直播中还包含了一些箭上摄像头视角 包括这个安装在舱外的摄像头
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.19,0:05:08.00,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}See that. That is Raptor number 49. Also note some flickering flames
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.19,0:05:08.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}看到了吗？那是49号猛禽 还有一些闪烁的火焰
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.00,0:05:12.17,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and over on the top right of that camera there's some flapping panels there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.00,0:05:12.17,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在摄像头的右上方有一些挡板
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.80,0:05:19.28,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Those are thermal protection materials that are protecting things like pressure vessels inside the skirt
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.80,0:05:19.28,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些都是保护裙板内的压力容器等设备的热保护材料
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.28,0:05:23.67,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and those are important later because I think that's what we see falling off.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.28,0:05:23.67,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而对于后面的事情 提到这些都是很重要的 因为我觉得这就是那些脱落的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.16,0:05:27.52,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}From this angle also notice that if you look straight up
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.16,0:05:27.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}从这个角度也能注意到 如果你直接向上看
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.52,0:05:31.14,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it does look like the flame. There's a bit of smoke in the air.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.52,0:05:31.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它看起来确实像是火焰(的影响) 空气中还有一点烟
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.91,0:05:33.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm not sure if that's significant.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.91,0:05:33.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不知道这是否是重要的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.60,0:05:38.82,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We're not sure if it's because it's perhaps running a little more fuel rich for throttle reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.60,0:05:38.82,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们不知道这是否是因为它为了节流而使用了富燃的混合比
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.52,0:05:45.12,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Frankly we don't know very much but yeah at this point it is a fairly long ascent
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.52,0:05:45.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}坦率地说 我们还不太清楚 但没错 在这时 SN9在进行一个相对耗时的上升段飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.12,0:05:49.02,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}where they deactivate the engines one by one until they reach apogee.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.12,0:05:49.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在这段飞行过程中 发动机一个接一个地被关闭 直到远地点
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.84,0:05:53.91,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Apogee being when SN9 gets as high as it's gonna get
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.84,0:05:53.91,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}远地点是指SN9到达最高点的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.91,0:05:57.62,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that on this flight happened around (T+)4:20.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.91,0:05:57.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而到达远地点的时刻为(T+)4:20左右
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.31,0:06:03.91,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this was about 10 kilometers up and by this point it's only flying on a single Raptor engine
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.31,0:06:03.91,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这差不多是在10公里的高空 此时它只用一台猛禽发动机在飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.91,0:06:08.40,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}enough to just keep it going at the velocity it was when all the others shut down.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.91,0:06:08.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}足以让它在其他发动机都关机的情况下保持速度
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.40,0:06:14.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So it cuts that off and then proceeds to go into the belly flop maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.40,0:06:14.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么SN9的这台发动机也关机了 然后继续进行机腹向下俯冲的动作
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.24,0:06:17.42,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}In this case they overcooked it just a bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.24,0:06:17.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这次 他们做得有点过火了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.46,0:06:19.54,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now we weren't sure about the camera angles on this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.46,0:06:19.54,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我们不太确定摄像机的拍摄角度
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.57,0:06:23.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it definitely looked like the nose goes down
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.57,0:06:23.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它看起来肯定是机头向下的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.60,0:06:26.80,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because if you look at other camera angles it seems to confirm this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.60,0:06:26.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为如果你看其他的拍摄角度 似乎可以证实这一点
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.80,0:06:28.87,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But then they use aerodynamics.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.80,0:06:28.87,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是他们使用了空气动力(来进行姿态的调整)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.90,0:06:34.73,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They increase the drag on the nose fins by folding them further out and the rear fins get folded in.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.90,0:06:34.73,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}增加机头翼面的阻力 让它们展得更开 而尾部翼面收得更紧
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.19,0:06:38.85,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they bring it down to the horizontal belly flop maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.19,0:06:38.85,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后SN9的机腹放平 (完成)机腹向下机动
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.03,0:06:41.75,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this of course maximizes the drag
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.03,0:06:41.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这当然会使阻力最大化
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.75,0:06:47.03,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and sets the terminal velocity initially it's about 300 400 kilometers per hour.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.75,0:06:47.03,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并设定了终端速度 最初的速度大约是每小时300到400千米
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.03,0:06:50.06,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But as they descend into the thicker parts of the atmosphere,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.03,0:06:50.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但当SN9下降到大气层较厚的部分时
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.31,0:06:54.86,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it drops down to about 250 kilometers per hour.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.31,0:06:54.86,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}速度会下降到大约每小时250公里
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.89,0:07:00.47,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I love these shots showing the finns actuating to control the descent.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.89,0:07:00.47,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我喜欢这些显示了翼面工作 控制航天器下降的镜头
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.47,0:07:02.95,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But the camera froze. Typical.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.47,0:07:02.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是画面卡住了 老卡顿了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.52,0:07:08.08,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But look the good news for this flight is the transition from the vertical to the horizontal
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.52,0:07:08.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但注意到这个飞行的好消息是 从垂直到水平的过渡
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.08,0:07:11.03,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and controlling the belly flop were really good.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.08,0:07:11.03,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}和(这部分的)机腹向下俯冲的控制都非常好
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.03,0:07:15.12,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It was consistent which means those were the things I had the biggest concern about.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.03,0:07:15.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这与SN8的表现一致 而这些是我最担心的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.26,0:07:19.48,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Oddly enough I haven't had huge concerns about the reliability of the Raptors.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.26,0:07:19.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}奇怪的是 我对猛禽的可靠性并没有太大的担忧
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.68,0:07:24.40,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Although given what happened next I'm perhaps beginning to reassess that situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.68,0:07:24.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}虽然鉴于接下来发生的事情 我或许要开始重新评估这种情况
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.40,0:07:29.66,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they're supposed to light up two Raptors and only one of the Raptors lights.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.40,0:07:29.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么他们应该启动两台猛禽 但只有一台猛禽点火了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.71,0:07:36.75,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The second one it just coughs it splutters and we end up going into fireball mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.71,0:07:36.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第二只猛禽只是咳嗽 发出PUI PUI声 而最终进入火球模式
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.76,0:07:39.95,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Okay so let's look at this in quarter speed.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.76,0:07:39.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}好了 让我们用四分之一的速度来看看这个片段
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.00,0:07:44.68,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}One thing to notice first of all is the nose by now is covered in frost
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.00,0:07:44.68,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}首先要注意的是机鼻上已经布满了霜
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.73,0:07:47.75,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because of course that's where the oxygen header tank is.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.73,0:07:47.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然因为那是氧气头部储箱的位置
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.75,0:07:51.11,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see the two vents coming out to the sides.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.59,0:07:54.83,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Those are from the engine chill system I believe.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.59,0:07:54.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想那是发动机冷却系统的排气口
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.36,0:08:01.27,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So as it gets close to the ground, it's falling at about 70 to 80 meters per second.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.36,0:08:01.27,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么当它接近地面时 它以每秒70到80米的速度下降
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.52,0:08:04.08,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it starts to go to light up the engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.52,0:08:04.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后开始启动发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.08,0:08:12.16,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the important thing to note is that the first engine comes on and starts generating really good mach diamond.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.08,0:08:12.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么最重要的是 第一台发动机启动后 开始产生非常好的马赫环
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.16,0:08:16.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So there's the ignition and you get a nice rocket-like flame.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.16,0:08:16.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这就是点火 你能看到一个漂亮的火箭般的火焰
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.28,0:08:21.37,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The second one goes up and it doesn't do that at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.28,0:08:21.37,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第二台发动机也在点火 但完全没点起来
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.84,0:08:28.35,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So note that the first engine keeps producing these good mac diamonds
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.84,0:08:28.35,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以请注意 第一台发动机一直在产生这些好的马赫环
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.38,0:08:30.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is an indication of good thrust all the way through.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.38,0:08:30.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这表明它一直在产生良好的推力
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.84,0:08:36.39,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It flares a bit here and there but it then recovers
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.84,0:08:36.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它(身上)也在到处喷火 但随后就恢复了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.44,0:08:38.95,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that engine is good all the way down.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.44,0:08:38.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以那台发动机一直都是好的
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.95,0:08:43.28,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's no failure going on there but the other engine fails to light.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.95,0:08:43.28,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这台发动机没出问题 但另一台发动机却无法点火
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.72,0:08:48.95,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which says to me that there may be a problem with that specific Raptor on the relight.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.72,0:08:48.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我觉得 可能只是那台猛禽发动机存在无法再次点火的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.95,0:08:52.64,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It wasn't a vehicle issue or it's most likely not a vehicle issue.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.95,0:08:52.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这不是航天器的问题 或者说很可能不是航天器的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.91,0:08:59.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's certainly not the low pressure any specific fuel or oxidizer system.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.91,0:08:59.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}肯定不是燃料或者氧化剂系统的低压问题
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.16,0:09:04.26,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it's something that affects that engine and not the other one.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.16,0:09:04.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但可能会是只影响这台发动机而不是那台的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.48,0:09:09.72,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Maybe there's a void or a bubble in the tank that went and caused the engine to stutter and fail.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.48,0:09:09.72,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也许储罐里存在空隙或者气泡 导致发动机的卡顿和故障
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.53,0:09:12.84,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We're not sure. We'll have to get more data.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.36,0:09:15.51,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now there's other things to see from this angle.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.36,0:09:15.51,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}从这个角度还可以看到其他的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.51,0:09:22.06,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}First of all, there's a couple of items that are seen to get blown out during this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.51,0:09:22.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}首先 有几件东西看上去在这期间被炸掉了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.56,0:09:26.34,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And as far as we can tell they are much lighter.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.56,0:09:26.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}据我们所知 它们的重量要轻得多
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.37,0:09:29.21,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So there's the first one shooting off to the left.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.37,0:09:29.21,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么第一个是向左边射过去的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.51,0:09:31.36,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it's getting caught up in the air.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.51,0:09:31.36,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它被空气托举起来了
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.36,0:09:34.39,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}We actually see that it falls slower than the rest of the vehicle.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.36,0:09:34.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们可以看到它的坠落速度比航天器的其他部分都要慢
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.48,0:09:37.40,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The second one is falling off to the right and off to the top.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.48,0:09:37.40,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}第二个则是向右和(画面)上部的脱落的
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.60,0:09:40.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So we think these are just shielding
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.60,0:09:40.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 我们认为这些只是(热)屏蔽材料
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.52,0:09:45.50,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that is inside the skirt to protect things like composite overwrapped pressure vessels.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.52,0:09:45.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}也就是安装在裙板内的东西 是为了保护像缠绕复合材料压力容器这样的东西
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.54,0:09:49.01,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}things that wouldn't react too well to too much heat.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.54,0:09:49.01,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些东西比较怕过多的热量
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.83,0:09:51.83,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}In fact if you watch this pass enough
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.83,0:09:51.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}事实上 如果你充分地观看这个片段
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.83,0:09:56.77,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you'll actually start to see the second thing bouncing around inside the skirt before it's blown out.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.83,0:09:56.77,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其实你会开始看到第二个东西在吹出去之前 在裙板内跳来跳去
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.30,0:10:01.38,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yeah if the other thing to watch is the engine that's failing slightly.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.30,0:10:01.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是 是的 如果还有另一件事情要注意 那就是轻微故障的那台发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.40,0:10:06.39,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}At this point you can actually see there's flames at the base of that engine or the head
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.40,0:10:06.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这时其实你可以看到在那台发动机的基部或者说头部有火焰
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.39,0:10:07.76,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because we're looking at it from below.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.39,0:10:07.76,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为我们是从下面看的
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.83,0:10:11.94,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the power head is very likely falling apart.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.83,0:10:11.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以发动机的动力头很可能是散架了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.24,0:10:16.32,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this is very much looking like an engine failing and coming apart
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.24,0:10:16.32,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这看起来很像是一台发动机发生了故障而解体了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.32,0:10:17.04,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the question is
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.32,0:10:17.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而问题是
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.04,0:10:21.17,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}was it a flaw in the engine? Did it just break because it'd been run for too long?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.04,0:10:21.17,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是发动机的缺陷吗？还是说运行时间太长而出了问题？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.44,0:10:24.24,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Or was there something in the system feeding it
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.44,0:10:24.24,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}或者说是推进剂供应系统供应了什么东西
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.24,0:10:29.42,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because yeah if you have a void in a pipe and it is being pumped hard enough into the engine
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.24,0:10:29.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为是的 如果你的管道内有空气 而被足够有力地泵到了发动机里
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.68,0:10:32.44,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}when that hits your pump or hits the impellers
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.68,0:10:32.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当它打到你的泵或打到涡轮的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.64,0:10:38.61,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it can damage your turbo pump destroy it and result in an RUD that looks very much like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.64,0:10:38.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它可能会损坏你的涡轮泵 并导致一个看起来很像这次爆炸的RUD
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.99,0:10:43.39,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we should point out this is very distinct from what happened on SN8.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.99,0:10:43.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们要指出的是 这与SN8的情况截然不同
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.66,0:10:47.88,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}In that case the Starship had a fuel supply problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.66,0:10:47.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那次Starship的燃料供应有问题
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.07,0:10:49.60,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Pressure was too low.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.07,0:10:49.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}压力太低
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.60,0:10:51.62,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The oxygen get fed into the engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.60,0:10:51.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}(过量)氧气进入发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.62,0:10:56.17,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we got this bright green flame of engine rich exhaust
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.62,0:10:56.17,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我们看到了富发动机燃烧的 明亮的绿色火焰
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.20,0:10:59.63,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}as the engine destroyed itself due to a failure in Starship.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.20,0:10:59.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为Starship内部(储罐)的问题 破坏了发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.92,0:11:02.88,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This could be a failure of the engine most likely
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.92,0:11:02.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而SN9很可能就是发动机的故障
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.88,0:11:07.63,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it could be something that only affects that engine in Starship fuel supply.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.88,0:11:07.63,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但也可能是Starship燃料供应(系统)中 只影响到的那台发动机的部分
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.70,0:11:12.76,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So we'll have to wait to find out what really happened here I suspect.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.70,0:11:12.76,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以我觉得我们得等着看看到底发生了什么
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.26,0:11:17.12,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now while SpaceX is no doubt going to be doing their own internal analysis.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.26,0:11:17.12,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么虽然SpaceX无疑会进行内部的分析
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.16,0:11:24.02,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The community are already out there, sleuthing in the way that a bunch of Texas tank watchers only can.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.16,0:11:24.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但(爱好者)社区已经在外面进行调查了 一群德克萨斯州的储罐观察者才会做的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.16,0:11:26.66,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So we have RGV Aerial photography
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.16,0:11:26.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么我们有了RGV航拍的图像

Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.73,0:11:32.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}刚在空域限制被取消后 就安排了飞越
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.61,0:11:38.97,1080P-sgbd-48,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And this is a very different scene to SN8 where we had very large chunks visible on the pad.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.61,0:11:38.97,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这里就与SN8的情况有了很大不同 着陆场上能看到很多大块

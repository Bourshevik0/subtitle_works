Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.09,0:08:47.61,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为这里面钚太少了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.36,0:08:54.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Now they can get estimates of what it should be in nature just by looking at things like meteorites
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.36,0:08:54.18,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么 他们可以通过观察陨石等东西和查看衰变产物的比例
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.20,0:08:58.18,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and looking at the ratios of the decay products

Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.22,0:09:03.01,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because of although the plutonium has decayed they're still trapped inside these meteorites
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.22,0:09:03.01,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为虽然钚已经衰变 但它们仍然被困在这些陨石中

Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.31,0:09:20.76,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因此 如果钚的值比根据这个环境预期的值低
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.02,0:09:27.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Then maybe that indicates that supernova aren't actually the main generators of these heavy actinide elements.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.02,0:09:27.16,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么这也许表明超新星实际上并不是这些重的锕元素的主要产生者
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.19,0:09:31.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and that would actually make sense because we were never sure there was enough neutron flux there.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.19,0:09:31.44,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,并且这实际上是有道理的 因为我们从未确定那里有足够的中子通量
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.44,0:09:36.86,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,And there is an alternate method for making these really heavy elements in large quantities
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.44,0:09:36.86,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,还有另一种方法可以大量制造这些重元素
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.92,0:09:39.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and that is neutron star mergers
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.92,0:09:39.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而那就是中子星的合并
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.43,0:09:43.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,where leftover neutron star cores they spiral into each other
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.43,0:09:43.83,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,在那种情况下 剩余的中子星核心会螺旋式地融入对方
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.83,0:09:47.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and as they spiral in they release a lot of energy
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.83,0:09:47.02,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,并且当它们螺旋式融入时 它们释放出大量的能量
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.04,0:09:51.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and this energy drives these neutrons off at relativistic speeds.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.04,0:09:51.11,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,而这些能量促使这些中子以相对论性速度离开

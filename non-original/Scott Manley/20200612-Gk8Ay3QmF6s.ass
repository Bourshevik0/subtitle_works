Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.61,0:02:43.29,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But I mean this is a really beautiful piece of engineering here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.61,0:02:43.29,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我是指 从工程美学的角度考虑 它是多么地优秀
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.29,0:02:47.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it's all about minimizing the amount of mass spent on the deployment system
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.29,0:02:47.70,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这都是为了最大限度地减少部署系统所花费的质量
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.01,0:02:51.48,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that you can have as many satellites as possible in a stack
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.01,0:02:51.48,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样你就可以在一次分离尽可能多的卫星
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.48,0:02:56.90,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and if you're willing to accept that your satellites might bump into each other and handle that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.48,0:02:56.90,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你愿意接受你的卫星可能会互相碰撞并能应对这种情况的话
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.18,0:03:03.63,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}then yes 60 satellites on the spacecraft compared to say OneWeb's much more conventional system
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.18,0:03:03.63,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 是的 60颗卫星在航天器上 相比之下 OneWeb的系统就要传统得多

Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.92,0:03:15.37,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they only put 34 satellites on but yeah these are launched at much lower cadence.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.92,0:03:15.37,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们只放了34颗卫星 但这些卫星的发射节奏要低得多
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.39,0:03:17.76,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There would be several minutes between each separation
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.39,0:03:17.76,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}每次分离之间会有几分钟的时间

Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.25,0:04:01.04,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because this is a camera inside the fairings watching the deployment
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.25,0:04:01.04,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这是在整流罩内观察部署情况的摄像头
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.34,0:04:04.81,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}while the second stage of the Falcon 9 is still firing
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.34,0:04:04.81,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}此时猎鹰9号的二级仍在点火
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.83,0:04:10.00,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you can see it flying up the middle off to the left but there's a lot to see in this footage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.83,0:04:10.00,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到它从中间飞向左边 但在这个镜头里有很多东西可以看
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.02,0:04:13.32,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I mean it's obviously amazing to see this point of view.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.02,0:04:13.32,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我是指 这个视角是很惊艳
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.76,0:04:14.63,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's beautiful.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.76,0:04:14.63,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}太美了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.10,0:04:19.97,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}All the textures in the exhaust are amazing but there's cool information to find here.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.10,0:04:19.97,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}排气管里的所有纹理都很惊人 但在这里同样可以找到很酷的信息
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.50,0:04:24.49,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now the first time we actually saw footage from fairings in space was
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.50,0:04:24.49,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 我们第一次真正看到整流罩在太空中的镜头是
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.52,0:04:28.54,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}actually because there was some in the Caribbean that was on the beach
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.52,0:04:28.54,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}其实是因为有人在加勒比海的海滩上
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.58,0:04:31.56,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and he found a giant piece of SpaceX fairing
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.58,0:04:31.56,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}找到了一块巨大的SpaceX整流罩残骸
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.81,0:04:35.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and on that they've found a GoPro in a special housing.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.81,0:04:35.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后在那上面找到了一个带有特殊罩子的GoPro相机
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.51,0:04:38.80,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So he took it out of the housing, sent that off to SpaceX
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.51,0:04:38.80,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}于是他把它从外壳里拿出来 寄给SpaceX了
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.83,0:04:42.60,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they were able to get the images off the camera.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.83,0:04:42.60,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样SpaceX才从相机里拿到了图像
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.02,0:04:47.01,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And then they published this fantastic video to to youtube.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.02,0:04:47.01,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后他们在youtube上发布了这段精彩的视频
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.01,0:04:51.52,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you get to see this fairings kind of spinning around in space and falling back to Earth.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.01,0:04:51.52,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以你可以看到这个整流罩在太空中旋转 然后落回地球上
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.87,0:04:53.80,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That I think at the top of the image,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.87,0:04:53.80,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在图片的顶部(的亮斑)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.80,0:04:56.16,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I think that's the upper stage engine firing.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.80,0:04:56.16,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想那是点火中的二级发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.20,0:05:01.22,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's the brightest thing there except the Sun which is about to come into frame
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.20,0:05:01.22,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}除了即将进入画面的太阳 它最亮
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.23,0:05:04.32,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and I think the Sun is probably brighter than the second stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.23,0:05:04.32,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且我觉得太阳可能比二级更亮
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.62,0:05:07.38,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yeah this is kind of beautiful. It goes on for a couple of minutes
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.62,0:05:07.38,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 没错 这画面挺美的 视频持续了几分钟
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.46,0:05:10.65,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it's set to the the waltz of the Blue Danube.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.46,0:05:10.65,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而它的背景音乐是蓝色多瑙河圆舞曲
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.04,0:05:12.57,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now this is a much older fairing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.04,0:05:12.57,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 这是一个老得多的整流罩
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.57,0:05:13.95,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's much simpler.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.57,0:05:13.95,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}(结构)简单多了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.21,0:05:19.62,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can see the acoustic tiles on the interior that protect the payload from the sonic environment.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.21,0:05:19.62,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到铺在内部的隔音砖 这是用于保护有效载荷不受环境声波的影响
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.68,0:05:25.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's some ducting that runs up the side from the payload or sorry that the fairing umbilical
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.68,0:05:25.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}有一些管道从整流罩的脐带向上延伸
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.50,0:05:26.76,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but you know that's it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.50,0:05:26.76,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但你知道的 差不多就这些了
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.49,0:05:31.72,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Then we have this footage from 2018 from the Paz satellite launch
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.49,0:05:31.72,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}接着是2018年Paz卫星发射时的这段画面
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.19,0:05:34.67,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the thing to note here I guess is on the left.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.19,0:05:34.67,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}要注意的是 我想是在左边
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.70,0:05:38.94,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now there's three your compressed gas bottles here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.70,0:05:38.94,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这里有三个压缩气体瓶
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.42,0:05:43.48,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is probably gas that's used for the reaction control thrusters
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.42,0:05:43.48,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这可能是用于反推力系统(RCS)的气体
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.49,0:05:47.25,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they want to control the descent so they need to get the attitude correct
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.49,0:05:47.25,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为可控的下降需要正确的姿态
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.25,0:05:52.16,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so it falls down like a surfboard rather than just flipping around out of control.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.25,0:05:52.16,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样 整流罩就能像冲浪板一样掉下来 而不是失控翻转
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.08,0:05:55.98,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}You can also see some rigging for the parachute recovery system
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.08,0:05:55.98,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你还可以看到一些降落伞回收系统的装备
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.98,0:06:00.21,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and if you look at the payload of course you can see it's sitting on top of the rocket
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.98,0:06:00.21,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你看一下有效载荷 当然你可以看到它是坐在火箭的顶部
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.21,0:06:06.05,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but the engine flares definitely highly overexposed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.21,0:06:06.05,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但发动机火焰绝对是过曝得很严重了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.95,0:06:11.20,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}The next fairing video we have is from the Arabsat-6A launch
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.95,0:06:11.20,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}下一个整流罩视频是Arabsat-6A的发射的时候拍的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.62,0:06:14.83,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and again of course you get to see the upper stage flyby.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.62,0:06:14.83,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 你也能看到二级的飞越
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.92,0:06:17.49,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It's a different environment. The Sun is from behind
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.92,0:06:17.49,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个不同的环境 太阳从后面照射过来
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.27,0:06:21.12,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the whole thing of course does a complete backflip
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.27,0:06:21.12,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而整个事情发生得截然相反
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.12,0:06:25.58,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you see the second stage disappearing off into the distance in the other direction.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.12,0:06:25.58,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你会看到二级消失在另一个方向的远方
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.16,0:06:30.69,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now I want you to again note the acoustic paneling on the interior of this fairing
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.16,0:06:30.69,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在我想让大家再注意一下这个整流罩内部的隔音砖
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.69,0:06:36.18,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because this fairing was the first ones to be successfully recovered and reused.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.69,0:06:36.18,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为这个整流罩是第一批被成功回收和再利用的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.21,0:06:42.74,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Again, this during the separation you have exposure problems but you do get to see the outline
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.21,0:06:42.74,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}同样 在分离过程中 你会遇到曝光问题 但你确实可以看到轮廓
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.76,0:06:48.16,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and get to see that a beautiful image of the second-stage Merlin engine shooting up the middle there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.76,0:06:48.16,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}可以看到二级梅林发动机从画面中间点火的美丽画面
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.82,0:06:54.06,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yeah when they went to reuse this, the acoustic paneling had been removed
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.82,0:06:54.06,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但当他们去重新使用这个整流罩的时候 隔音砖已经被拆除了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.08,0:06:58.43,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so this was the second Starlink mission in November 2019.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.08,0:06:58.43,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这是2019年11月的第二次Starlink任务的发射画面
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.79,0:07:01.63,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Again this is another example of the Starlink satellites
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.66,0:07:04.84,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}being designed for a rougher environment than most satellites.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.79,0:07:01.63,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这又是一个例子
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.66,0:07:04.84,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}说明星链卫星在设计上相比大多数其他卫星 能够耐受更恶劣的环境
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.29,0:07:09.82,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yeah they don't need the extra protection that the acoustic shielding offers.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.29,0:07:09.82,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以是的 他们不需要隔音砖提供的额外保护
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.37,0:07:14.66,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And finally in July we had the STP mission on the Falcon Heavy
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.37,0:07:14.66,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}最后在(2019年)7月 重型猎鹰进行的STP任务的整流罩画面
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.68,0:07:17.15,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and look how much space is left in that fairing there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.68,0:07:17.15,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}看那整流罩里还剩多少空间
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.15,0:07:18.31,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This was a test mission
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.15,0:07:18.31,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是个测试任务
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.59,0:07:25.07,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4\fs49}which meant the fairing was released at much higher velocities and altitudes than the fairings are usually deployed
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.59,0:07:25.07,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这意味着整流罩的分离速度和高度远远高于通常情况
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.11,0:07:30.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so the best part about this video is the fairing performed its re-entry maneuver.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.11,0:07:30.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这段视频最精彩的部分是整流罩进行了再入机动
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.52,0:07:34.84,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And we got to watch the re-entry looking back into the plasma stream.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.52,0:07:34.84,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们可以看到在再入的过程中 镜头朝向(整流罩运动方向)后面的等离子流的画面
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.41,0:07:38.30,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And of course this is an absolutely beautiful video.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.41,0:07:38.30,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 这是一个绝对美丽的视频
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.39,0:07:44.75,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I wouldn't take to the colors as being accurate because they probably removed the infrared filter
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.39,0:07:44.75,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不认为颜色是准确的 因为他们可能去掉了红外滤镜
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.75,0:07:49.31,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but yeah again you know some great images from inside fairings.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.75,0:07:49.31,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但同样也是 一些从整流罩内部拍摄的绝美的画面
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.98,0:07:52.49,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So let's look back at the new video and see what we can see.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.98,0:07:52.49,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 让我们回头看看最新的视频 看看我们能发现什么
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.49,0:07:55.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Well obviously there's none of the acoustic paneling here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.49,0:07:55.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很明显 这里没有任何的隔音砖
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.18,0:07:58.12,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Over on the left you can see a bright light.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.18,0:07:58.12,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在左边你可以看到一个亮光
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.21,0:08:02.50,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}That is presumably the light for the camera on the other half of the fairing.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.21,0:08:02.50,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这大概是另一半整流罩上摄像头的灯光
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.50,0:08:05.26,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}These two fairings are essentially identical

Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.71,0:09:58.85,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想在这里暂停一下
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.86,0:10:04.53,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because you can see the limb of the Earth reflected in the edge of that Starlink stack.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.86,0:10:04.53,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为你可以看到星链堆的边缘反射着地球的边缘

Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.79,0:10:07.32,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now the plume behind it,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.79,0:10:07.32,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在看看后面的羽状物
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.41,0:10:12.51,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'm not clear just how much of this was illumination from the Sun and how much is illumination from the engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.41,0:10:12.51,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我不清楚这其中有多少是来自太阳的照射 多少是来自发动机的照射
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.97,0:10:15.32,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They had launched about an hour after dark.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.97,0:10:15.32,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这次发射发生在天黑后一小时
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.40,0:10:21.54,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And at some point it probably flew into sunlight but some of this illumination might come from the engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.40,0:10:21.54,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在某些时候 它可能飞到了阳光下 但其中一些照明可能来自发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.69,0:10:23.72,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I'd have to actually do a bit more math on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.69,0:10:23.72,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我还得再实际计算一下
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.57,0:10:26.16,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Either way it's beautiful.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.03,0:10:31.83,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I also wanted to draw your attention to this cylindrical shaped object at the back.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.03,0:10:31.83,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我还想提请大家注意后面这个圆柱形的物体
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.87,0:10:34.88,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I think this is part of the parachute deployment system.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.87,0:10:34.88,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想这是降落伞部署系统的一部分
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.98,0:10:36.91,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This is a drogue chute mortar.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.98,0:10:36.91,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这是一个降落伞弹出设备
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.24,0:10:41.97,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So since we're inside of fairing, it's protecting everything behind it from air flow
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.24,0:10:41.97,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为整流罩挡住了气流 所以能保护内侧的设备不受气流影响
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.97,0:10:44.31,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so if you have a parachute that has to deploy from here,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.97,0:10:44.31,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因此降落伞只能放在整流罩的内侧
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.31,0:10:49.32,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it has to be thrown out beyond the range at which the fairing is messing up the air flow.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.31,0:10:49.32,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它必须在整流罩扰乱气流的区域之外被抛出
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.64,0:10:55.41,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that will fire it back. It'll catch the airflow and then it'll pull the rest of the parachute out
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.64,0:10:55.41,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样 降落伞就往运动的反方向发射 抓住气流 然后把其余部分拉出来
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.42,0:10:57.71,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then of course it'll deploy like a wing.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.42,0:10:57.71,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后当然就像机翼一样展开
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.50,0:11:04.85,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So we fall down next to it and you can catch a glimpse off the engine there blowing out that exhaust.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.50,0:11:04.85,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在 整流罩掉落在二级附近 你可以瞥见发动机喷出的废气
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.00,0:11:09.93,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If you look at the bottom of the fairing straight down, you can see the exhaust starts hitting the fairing.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.00,0:11:09.93,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你直着看整流罩的底部 能看到废气开始撞击整流罩
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.59,0:11:15.48,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So if you look carefully, the rotation of the fairing actually flips around.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.59,0:11:15.48,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么如果你仔细看 整流罩其实是翻转的
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.48,0:11:18.72,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Initially it pitches outwards from the top because we are looking down
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.48,0:11:18.72,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}起初是从顶部向外翻转的 因为我们是向下看的
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.35,0:11:23.88,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then suddenly when it hits that, the exhaust flips the rotation
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.35,0:11:23.88,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后突然间 废气撞到了整流罩 改变了翻转的方向
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.88,0:11:25.79,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it starts rotating the opposite direction
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.88,0:11:25.79,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后开始反方向旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.82,0:11:31.41,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and finally we end up looking down towards the Earth which is still, you know, night.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.82,0:11:31.41,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}视频的最后 还是指向了下方的夜间的地球
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.57,0:11:33.60,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And I have to play this again because of stuff that I missed.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.57,0:11:33.60,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我必须再放一遍 因为我错过了一些东西
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.65,0:11:39.00,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}There's a Starlink stack obviously I think that's about you know 14 feet away you know 4 or 5 meters.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.65,0:11:39.00,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这里有一个星链堆栈 很明显 我想那是14英尺远的地方 你知道的 4到5米
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.49,0:11:44.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So watch the bottom of the fairing looking on the right side. Watch as it wobbles in and out.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.49,0:11:44.70,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以看下画面右边 整流罩的底部 它在向内外摇摆
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.86,0:11:48.20,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Because that's held together mechanically and then given a kick,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:44.86,0:11:48.20,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为整流罩的两半是用机械方式固定在一起的 然后在接合处施加力
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.21,0:11:50.88,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the whole thing wobbles back and forth initially.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.21,0:11:50.88,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}整个东西就开始来回晃动
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.29,0:11:56.05,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Again you see the plume hitting it and reversing the rotation there,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.29,0:11:56.05,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}再看一次 尾焰的羽流撞击到它 然后整流罩就开始反向旋转
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.97,0:12:01.30,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}as the fairing starts to point the other way it looks straight back into the exhaust
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.97,0:12:01.30,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当整流罩开始指向另一个方向时 它开始直直地往废气运动的方向翻转
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.32,0:12:02.82,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and there's a black area there
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.32,0:12:02.82,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且那里有一个黑色的区域
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.86,0:12:07.70,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because that is the area of the exhaust. There's being shielded by the payload fairing structure
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.86,0:12:07.70,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为那里(原先)是废气所在的区域 (但是)整流罩把中间这一块的废气挡住了
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.70,0:12:13.23,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so it looks like you're looking down into this black hole amongst a bunch of clouds.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.70,0:12:13.23,1080P-shsm-75,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以这就看起来像是一堆云中间的黑洞
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.95,0:12:17.22,1080P-shsb-50,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And there's just one more photo if you look in this one,

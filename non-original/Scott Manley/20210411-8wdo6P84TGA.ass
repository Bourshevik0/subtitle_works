Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.76,0:00:26.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now these fairings are flying vehicles in their own right
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.76,0:00:26.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这些整流罩本身就是飞行器了 对吧

Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.82,0:00:42.66,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当我在SpaceX的工厂里
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.66,0:00:48.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}you could see that the fairing manufacturer just took a huge section of the factory floor on its own.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.66,0:00:48.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}你可以看到 整流罩制造商就这样把工厂里的一大块地方给占了
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.00,0:00:51.49,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So I can see why recovery was justified.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.00,0:00:51.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以我可以理解为什么回收是合理的
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.31,0:00:57.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So both ships had made successful catches in their career using the massive nets
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.31,0:00:57.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这两艘船在它们的职业生涯中都曾利用巨大的网成功地捕获过整流罩
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.31,0:00:59.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but the experience hasn't all been good

Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.76,0:01:14.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but then were pulled off and damaged as the parafoils failed to separate.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.76,0:01:14.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但后来由于翼伞未能分离 导致整流罩被其拉力撕开
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.14,0:01:20.50,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And after some rough seas we've seen ships come back with damaged nets
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.14,0:01:20.50,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而在经历了一些糟糕的海况之后 我们看到船只会带着损坏的网子回来了
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.54,0:01:27.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}or even missing arms just due to the problems of navigating such unwieldy vessels on the high seas.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.54,0:01:27.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}甚至连网子的支撑臂都搞丢了 因为在公海上驾驶这种笨重的船只会出问题
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.93,0:01:31.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But I think perhaps most importantly the fairings recovered from the water
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.93,0:01:31.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我认为最重要的可能是从水中回收的整流罩

Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.97,0:03:25.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I don't think they're recovering any fairings from underwater
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.97,0:03:25.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然我不认为他们会从水下回收任何整流罩
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.86,0:03:28.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but point is that's what it's been designed for.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.86,0:03:28.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但重点是 这就是这艘船的设计目的
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.86,0:03:33.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yeah this ship has been practicing fairing recovery off the coast for the last few weeks.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.86,0:03:33.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么是的 这艘船在过去的几周一直在沿海实践整流罩回收
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.14,0:03:39.32,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And Wednesday's Starlink launch number 23 was its first attempt to do it for real

Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.18,0:06:02.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they were all constructed in Louisiana
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.18,0:06:02.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么它们都是在路易斯安那州建造的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.95,0:06:08.47,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and to get to the west coast incidentally the JRTI had to go through the Panama Canal

Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.68,0:06:15.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以着陆台的扩展就像沿边的机翼一样延伸
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.52,0:06:20.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Those were built but they weren't loaded onto the deck of JRTI
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.52,0:06:20.10,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些都是(一起)制造出来的 但它们并没有被装到JRTI的甲板上
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.11,0:06:21.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so we could navigate the canal.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.10,0:06:32.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that meant for the return trip they had to cut these off again
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.10,0:06:32.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这意味着在回程时 他们不得不再次把这些东西剪掉

Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.24,0:06:49.85,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当时他们还在研究着陆问题
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.42,0:06:56.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And I guess that some lessons they might have learned during this resulted in changes to OCISLY
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.42,0:06:56.56,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我猜想 他们在这期间可能吸取了一些教训 导致了OCISLY的改变
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.78,0:07:00.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that would actually be the first drone ship to be used and to recover a booster.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.78,0:07:00.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这将是第一艘实际回收助推器的无人船
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.84,0:07:04.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}I think they probably just scrap the original JRTI.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.84,0:07:04.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我想他们可能就直接放弃了原来的JRTI
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.74,0:07:08.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And the current one follows the design of OCISLY.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.84,0:07:27.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So anyway while those drone ships have their own propulsion with the azimuth thrusters to hold position
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.84,0:07:27.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么不管怎么说 虽然那些无人船使用自己的全向推进器来保持位置
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.51,0:07:31.34,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they don't actually travel long distances under their own power.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.51,0:07:31.34,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它们实际上并不依靠自己的动力进行长途旅行
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.35,0:07:34.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Instead they're towed to the landing sites by tugs

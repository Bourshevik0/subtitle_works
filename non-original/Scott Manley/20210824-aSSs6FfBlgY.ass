Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.12,0:00:53.60,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,但未能在着陆后完成这一工作
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.60,0:00:56.80,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,so those are the other two candidates for soft landing
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.60,0:00:56.80,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么这就是另外两个软着陆的候选者
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.80,0:01:00.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but let's be clear this is vastly more successful

Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.32,0:01:09.28,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,Now immediately after landing there weren't any photos available and it took them several days
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.32,0:01:09.28,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,那么 在着陆之后不久 没有任何照片 而且他们花了几天时间
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.28,0:01:16.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,because the rover on the surface had a direct uplink that had a bit rate of like 16 bit/s
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.28,0:01:16.64,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,因为火表上的着陆器(到地球的)直接上行链路带宽大约为16位/秒
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.64,0:01:19.98,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,and they weren't about to start uploading megabytes of images over that.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.32,0:01:50.62,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,其熔点与火星(地表)的温度差不多
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.65,0:01:53.58,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,So it warms up during the day and cools down at night
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.65,0:01:53.58,1080P-shss-90,,0,0,0,,所以它在白天升温 在晚上降温
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.66,0:01:56.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,but it tends to stay around that freezing point.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.77,0:00:32.88,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}This design obviously didn't become the Space Shuttle orbiter
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.77,0:00:32.88,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}很显然 这个设计没有变成航天飞机轨道器
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.88,0:00:35.00,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but later in the 1970s,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.32,0:00:43.87,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}the US was very interested in the possibility of building a network of 60 giant solar power satellites in space.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.28,0:01:17.93,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So yes in october of 1977,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.28,0:01:17.93,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 在1977年10月
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.94,0:01:22.99,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}a team of Rockwell international engineers got together to study this Space Raker design.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.60,0:01:31.19,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It was going to be 100m long, 93m wide and it would have carried about 90t to low Earth orbit.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.60,0:01:31.19,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它将会有100米长 93米宽 近地轨道运载能力大约90吨
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.20,0:01:37.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They anticipated it would need over a thousand flights per year to support the space power system program
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.20,0:01:37.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}为了支持太空能源系统的计划 他们预计每年需要超过一千次的飞行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.84,0:01:40.75,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}that would mean like one launch every eight hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.84,0:01:40.75,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这意味着每8小时发射一次
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.04,0:01:44.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}For this it could actually operate from a regular runway.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.04,0:01:44.43,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}为此 它实际上可以从一条普通的跑道上运行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.98,0:01:48.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They would obviously need to supply the liquid hydrogen, the engines needed
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.98,0:01:48.56,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}显然 (跑道虽然普通 但是)他们需要提供发动机需要的燃料 液氢
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.56,0:01:51.36,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but other than that they could operate anywhere in the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.56,0:01:51.36,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但除此之外 他们可以在世界的任何地方运行
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.36,0:01:53.52,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And this was of course seen in it as an advantage
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.36,0:01:53.52,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这当然被看作是一个优势
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.52,0:02:00.34,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they could pick up hardware from airports all over the US, integrate and then take it to orbit.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.52,0:02:00.34,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为他们可以从美国各地的机场搭载设备 整合后再送入轨道
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.15,0:02:04.79,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now for a launch to orbit it would also have to be loaded with liquid oxygen
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.15,0:02:04.79,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}现在 要想发射到轨道上 还得加注液氢
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.79,0:02:09.11,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so that plus the cargo would bring its mass to about 2000 tons.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.79,0:02:09.11,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么再加上货物 将使其质量达到2000吨左右
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.11,0:02:12.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}To get this much off the runway, they would have an extra set of landing gear
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.11,0:02:12.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}为了让这么多的货物离开跑道 这架飞机将配备一套额外的起落架
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.95,0:02:18.40,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which would be attached and then dropped after takeoff so that that would then be recovered.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.95,0:02:18.40,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}起飞前接上 起飞后再扔掉 这样就可以回收起落架了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.40,0:02:22.87,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now the jet engines there were 10 of them and they were basically magic.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.40,0:02:22.87,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 飞机上搭载了10台喷气式发动机 但这些发动机基本上都充满魔法(笑)
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.46,0:02:27.87,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They would start out as turbo jets and turned into with with afterburners.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.46,0:02:27.87,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}一开始是涡轮喷气发动机 然后使用后燃器
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.23,0:02:31.51,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They would switch mode and ultimately become ram jets
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.23,0:02:31.51,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}之后切换模式 并最终成为冲压式喷气发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.51,0:02:37.16,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they would work, producing thrust all the way up to about mach 6.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.51,0:02:37.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}发动机工作并产生推力 一直到6马赫左右
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.59,0:02:42.81,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And it reaches the speed of mach 6 accelerating through a climb.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.59,0:02:42.81,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}通过爬升加速 飞机将达到6马赫的速度
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.20,0:02:52.10,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So the launch trajectory had it reaching mach 6 at about 29 km of altitude. That's about 18mi about 100000ft.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.20,0:02:52.10,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么发射轨道是在29公里(18英里/10万英尺)的高度达到6马赫的速度
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.64,0:02:55.68,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And by then of course, the air does start to get thinner.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.64,0:02:55.68,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 到那时 空气开始变稀薄
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.68,0:02:59.27,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And that's the point where they turn on the three main engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.68,0:02:59.27,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这时 三台主引擎点火
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.51,0:03:06.44,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}These are hydrogen oxygen rocket engines and they generate combined thrust of about 1500 tons.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.87,0:03:14.36,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now it's worth noting that the propellant for these jet engines is stored inside these very large wings
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.87,0:03:14.36,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}值得注意的是 这些喷气发动机的推进剂 储存在这些非常大的机翼里

Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.33,0:03:30.95,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So at this point it's about mach 7.2. It shuts down the jet engines
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.33,0:03:30.95,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}到了差不多7.2马赫时 喷气式发动机关机
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.95,0:03:36.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and closes the air intakes for aerodynamics and now it's entirely on rocket power.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.12,0:08:29.19,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而实际上这种机动并不能帮助它提高有效载荷能力(因为大气内机动会消耗不少燃料)
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.19,0:08:36.00,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but more importantly since this was for a plan to put geostationary solar power satellites up there,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.19,0:08:36.00,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但更重要的是 因为计划里是为了把太阳能卫星送入地球静止轨道(GEO)
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.15,0:08:41.84,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}it would mean that launching that hardware into geostationary orbit would have required less fuel.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.12,0:09:03.50,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但最终他们还是放弃了这个想法
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.50,0:09:06.96,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and they decided everything would be launching into a 28 degree orbit.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.04,0:09:14.72,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且重新发射前只需要极少量的检查
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.87,0:09:20.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They would land it, load the new hardware, attach the extra gear for the ground launch

Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.60,0:09:37.25,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they didn't envisage this whole thing ramping up and starting until like 2000
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.60,0:09:37.25,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们设想中这一切只会在2000年之后才开始
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.64,0:09:42.82,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which is probably why they expected liquid hydrogen to be available at basically any air airport.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.64,0:09:42.82,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这大概就是为什么他们会期待每个机场里基本都提供液氢
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.83,0:09:45.44,1080P-sgbd-4t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But it also gave them two decades to solve their problems
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.83,0:09:45.44,1080P-sgsm-6t,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这也给了他们二十年的时间来解决他们的问题

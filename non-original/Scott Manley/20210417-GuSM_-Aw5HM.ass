Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.84,0:02:07.11,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that's a question best answered using Kerbal Space Program rather than actual science.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.84,0:02:07.11,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}像这种问题更适合用坎巴拉太空计划而不是实际的科学来回答

Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.56,0:02:27.60,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But these were all largely driven by cost.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.56,0:02:27.60,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但这些主要都是由费用驱动的

Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.38,0:02:30.61,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}费用是最大的问题
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.20,0:02:35.82,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}If you remember the previous administration had basically asked for something like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.20,0:02:35.82,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}如果你还记得上届政府基本上要求了这些东西 比如
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.95,0:02:40.02,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}three billion dollars to fund the Human Landing System development program
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.95,0:02:40.02,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}要求用30亿美元资助载人着陆系统开发项目
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.36,0:02:43.76,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and congress was like well we can't steer this money to our district
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.36,0:02:43.76,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而国会是这样的 好吧 我们不能引导这些钱到我们的地区(选区)
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.82,0:02:45.65,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so we're just going to give you a billion dollars.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.82,0:02:45.65,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么 我们只给你10亿美元
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.68,0:02:46.52,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It wasn't even that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.68,0:02:46.52,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}甚至都没达到

Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.54,0:02:47.27,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}可能已经更少
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.76,0:02:50.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But within that lower budget
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.76,0:02:50.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但在这个较低的预算范围内

Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.73,0:02:56.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所提交的备选方案实际上都不能按这一水平来提供资金
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.17,0:03:00.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so NASA worked with the various bidders
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.17,0:03:00.70,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以NASA与投标人合作
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.70,0:03:05.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and got SpaceX to not change the amount of money they were asking for
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.70,0:03:05.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并得以让SpaceX不改变他们要求的费用
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.84,0:03:11.07,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but to adjust the timeline so the first year could fit within the money that they had available
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.84,0:03:11.07,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但去调整时间表 以让第一年的研发能在他们现有的资金范围内完成
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.10,0:03:15.06,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and SpaceX were the only one that were even remotely in the ballpark
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.10,0:03:15.06,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而SpaceX提供的方案是唯一的那个资金(本就比较低且)方便调整的

Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.42,0:04:25.38,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but I'm hoping this doesn't mean so much that SpaceX has a chance of losing this.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.42,0:04:25.38,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但我希望这并不意味着SpaceX会失去这个项目
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.40,0:04:30.98,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So much that we have a chance to get the funding you would need for a second option

Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.04,0:05:33.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后还有一个像轨道拖船一样的轨道级
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.48,0:05:39.39,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}which would carry this stack from the halo orbit at the gateway down to low lunar orbit
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.48,0:05:39.39,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}会把这个组合体从轨道门户的晕轮轨道运到低月球轨道
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.88,0:05:43.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then stay in orbit and then when the ascent element returned

Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.20,0:05:51.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So this in many ways matched what NASA was looking for
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.20,0:05:51.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这在很多方面都符合NASA的要求
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.98,0:05:56.46,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but it didn't win because it turns out that it was very expensive and there were technical issues.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.98,0:05:56.46,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但它没有赢 因为事实证明 它是非常昂贵的 而且有技术问题

Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.84,0:06:06.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because instead of building this thing as a vertical stack they sort of built it sideways
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.84,0:06:06.55,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为他们没有把这个组合体竖着造 而是横着造

Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.56,0:06:12.08,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样 驾驶舱就可以放中间 (这样着陆后 驾驶舱就)差不多就完全在月球上了
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.12,0:06:15.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So you could actually step out of the airlock and down a couple of steps onto the moon
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.12,0:06:15.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么实际上你可以走出气闸 (只需)走下几级台阶就能到月球上
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.84,0:06:20.77,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}rather than descending this really huge ladder on the side of the national team.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.80,0:06:28.83,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And to be fair Dynetics lander was that tall if you included the solar panels that stuck upwards.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.80,0:06:28.83,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且公平地说 Dynetics的着陆器也有这么高 如果你算上向上伸出的太阳能电池板
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.87,0:06:32.05,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But yeah the rocket engines would be on the side
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.87,0:06:32.05,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但是 是的 火箭发动机会在侧面
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.29,0:06:37.86,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and then they would have drop tanks that would be dropped during the descent towards the moon.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.29,0:06:37.86,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}然后他们会在向月球下降的过程中扔下储罐
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.06,0:06:41.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And anyway and then we finally come to Starship.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.43,0:06:50.86,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而月球版Starship是一个略有不同的版本 它被涂成了白色
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.15,0:06:53.91,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It has a ring of solar panels a black section around.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.15,0:06:53.91,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}它有一圈太阳能电池板 也就是那一圈黑色的部分
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.78,0:06:58.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}It has none of the fins because there's no air on the moon
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.78,0:06:58.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为月球上没有空气 所以它没有翼面
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.31,0:07:00.56,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and you have to actually use rocket engines to slow down
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.31,0:07:00.56,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而你必须真的去用火箭发动机来减速
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.56,0:07:06.72,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but for final landing it had a ring of angled engines about halfway up the rocket
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.56,0:07:06.72,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但为了最后的着陆 大约在火箭的一半处 有一圈倾斜的发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.72,0:07:08.98,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and we're not clear what those engines are
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.72,0:07:08.98,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而我们也不清楚这些发动机是什么
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.00,0:07:12.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but the new render shows that there's something like 25 of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.00,0:07:12.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但新的渲染图显示 有约25台这样的发动机
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.98,0:07:16.20,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So that's far too many for them to be super dracos
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.98,0:07:16.20,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么他们的数量可太多了 不可能是超级天龙座
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.27,0:07:19.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so this would probably have to be some sort of new thruster
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.27,0:07:19.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以 这可能必须得是某种新的推进器

Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.30,0:07:40.16,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}显然都偏小而且是临时性质的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.22,0:07:44.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}but even when they get towards a production leg design
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.22,0:07:44.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但即使他们去设计量产版的着陆腿时

Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.92,0:13:22.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And a lot of this is down to SpaceX already developing it with their own money and with other investors
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.92,0:13:22.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这很大程度上归功于SpaceX已经用自己和其他投资者的钱一起开发了它
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.48,0:13:28.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because they have specific tasks in mind not just for Starship but for Super Heavy in general

Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.42,0:13:37.49,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But that's ultimately how this works.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.42,0:13:37.49,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但根本上 Starship方案就是这样
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.76,0:13:42.62,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And you of course this then says well what does that mean for the rest of Artemis
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.76,0:13:42.62,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而你当然会问 这对阿尔忒弥斯的其他部分来说意味着什么？

Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.08,0:01:48.04,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}之后花了大约一年的时间来观察这颗小行星的表面 试图找到一个可以取样的目标
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.88,0:01:54.72,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they had a slight problem because when they originally looked at Bennu as a candidate
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.88,0:01:54.72,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而他们遇到了一个小问题 因为最初把贝努选入的时候

Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.28,0:02:08.64,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and it would be like going to a sandy beach where they could just grab a you know chunk off the surface.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.28,0:02:08.64,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这就像去一个沙滩上 他们可以从其表面上抓一大块儿(样本)

Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.24,0:02:19.30,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they had to work very hard to find areas on the surface they could sample.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.24,0:02:19.30,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们必须非常努力地在表面寻找可以取样的区域
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.31,0:02:22.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Not only that but because of these big boulders
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.31,0:02:22.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}不仅如此 由于这些大石头的存在
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.51,0:02:26.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they actually had to change the way they plan to navigate the spacecraft during the sampling.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.51,0:02:26.92,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}事实上 他们不得不改变计划在取样过程中对航天器进行导航的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.95,0:02:31.68,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Originally they were just going to use Lidar to tell them when they were close to the surface
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.95,0:02:31.68,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}原本他们只是打算用激光测距仪来决定什么时候接近地面
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.29,0:02:37.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and with that they figured they could get within 25 meters of their sample site and that would be fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.29,0:02:37.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而有了这个 他们就觉得可以在25米以内的取样点进行测量了
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.76,0:02:43.10,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}When they looked at the sample sites they realized they would need precision of about five meters
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.76,0:02:43.10,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}在查看样本点时 他们意识到精度需要5米左右
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.42,0:02:46.48,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}or they ran the risk of hitting you know boulders nearby.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.42,0:02:46.48,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}否则就可能撞到附近的巨石上
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.48,0:02:51.23,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And one of the boulders next to one of the sites was christened mount doom
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.48,0:02:51.23,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而其中一个地点旁边的巨石被命名为厄运山
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.56,0:02:56.35,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}because it would have spelled certain doom for the spacecraft you had it actually hit it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.56,0:02:56.35,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}因为如果航天器撞上了它 就会发生灭顶之灾
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.20,0:03:01.55,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So they actually performed a software upgrade on the spacecraft
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.20,0:03:01.55,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以他们对航天器进行了软件升级
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.85,0:03:06.69,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}to give it optical navigation capabilities where it could look at images from the camera
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.85,0:03:06.69,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}给它增加了光学导航功能 使它可以查看来自相机的图像
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.94,0:03:11.21,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}identify important features and track those to make sure it was on course.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.94,0:03:11.21,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}并识别跟踪重要的特征 以确保航向不偏离
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.77,0:03:17.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So during the sampling procedure when we were watching it live on NASA TV
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.77,0:03:17.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么在取样过程中 当我们在NASA电视上观看它的现场直播时
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.92,0:03:20.15,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}we could only see a simulation of what was going on.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.92,0:03:20.15,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}我们只能看到实时的模拟过程
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.15,0:03:22.44,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They had been rehearsing this several times.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.15,0:03:22.44,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而他们已经演练了好几次了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.46,0:03:24.27,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They had the data. They had the images.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.46,0:03:24.27,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}他们有数据和图像
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.56,0:03:29.92,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}But the live data coming back from the spacecraft was only 40 bits per second.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.03,0:06:16.70,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And as they examined it more they noticed that the mylar one waste disc was open
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.03,0:06:16.70,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而当他们进一步检查时 发现聚脂盘是打开的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.19,0:06:21.94,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}so it was actually being propped open by some large object a few centimeters across.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.19,0:06:21.94,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么这个聚酯盘实际上是被一些直径几厘米的大物体撑开的

Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.98,0:06:26.80,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这些东西在气体的推动下卡在了那里
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.34,0:06:33.78,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And because this was open that meant that material was able to leak out.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.34,0:06:33.78,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而因为它是开放的 这意味着材料会泄漏出来
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.01,0:06:38.42,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And every time they were moving this sample head around to get a new orientation
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.01,0:06:38.42,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而且每当他们移动取样头改变姿态的时候
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.72,0:06:41.57,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they would be imparting kinetic energy to the particles
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.72,0:06:41.57,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样的动作都会把动能传给微粒
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.61,0:06:44.43,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and those were bouncing around and some of those were escaping.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.61,0:06:44.43,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样微粒就会弹来弹去 甚至逃逸
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.88,0:06:49.59,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So while they might have a kilogram or more of material,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.88,0:06:49.59,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}所以虽然可能采到了1kg甚至更多的材料
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.98,0:06:52.85,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they're slowly losing it every time they move this.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.98,0:06:52.85,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}但每动一次就会慢慢丢失材料

Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.44,0:06:56.78,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}原本计划是要称这个罐子
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.78,0:06:57.98,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and the way they would do this
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.78,0:06:57.98,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而称量的方法
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.30,0:07:04.14,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}was to put the canister out on the end of the longest arm position and then rotate the spacecraft
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.30,0:07:04.14,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}是把样本罐放在取样臂的最远端 然后旋转航天器
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.15,0:07:07.90,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and from that they would be able to determine the moment of inertia of the system.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.15,0:07:07.90,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}由此他们就能确定系统的惯性矩
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.68,0:07:12.00,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And therefore how much it had changed from having mass in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.68,0:07:12.00,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}这样就能确定质量的变化量
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.98,0:07:17.69,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}Now because they see that they likely have a fair amount of material
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.98,0:07:17.69,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么因为他们看到材料的量很可能已经很多了
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.13,0:07:21.09,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}and that they're losing it whenever they're moving it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.13,0:07:21.09,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而每当材料移动的时候 就会有一定的损失
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.68,0:07:24.31,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}they've decided that they're going to cut that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.68,0:07:24.31,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}于是他们已经决定 要砍掉测量质量的这个操作
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.31,0:07:27.84,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And they are re-prioritizing the entire set of operations
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.31,0:07:27.84,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而他们正重新安排整个行动的优先次序

Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.41,0:07:39.88,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}So on the side of the spacecraft there is a re-entry vehicle, a sample return capsule.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.41,0:07:39.88,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}那么在航天器的侧面有一个再入飞行器或者说一个样品返回舱

Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.14,0:07:47.97,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And in there there's a receptacle where they can latch this canister onto it. Put it in place.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.14,0:07:47.97,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}返回舱里有个容器 可以锁住这个罐子 并固定好
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.43,0:07:52.13,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}They will then have to detach it from the sampling arm.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.43,0:07:52.13,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}当然 样品罐得从取样臂上卸下来
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.87,0:07:57.26,1080P-sgbd-42,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}And this is not a trivial operation because there's mechanical joints here
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.87,0:07:57.26,1080P-sgsm-63,,0,0,0,,{\blur4}而这不是一个简单的操作 因为这里有机械接头

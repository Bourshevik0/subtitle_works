Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.58,0:06:32.00,字幕_720p,,0,0,0,,Head-on attack on such a ship didn't sound very tempting.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.00,0:06:34.96,字幕_720p,,0,0,0,,In the end the British decided to take a different approach.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.32,0:06:40.44,字幕_720p,,0,0,0,,There was only a handful of places around the world that could accommodate the German monstrosity
